Description:
   The resample tool resamples the input file to produce a new
   file with the given pixel size.  Resampling is accomplished with a
   square filter kernel centered on the pixel to best interpolate the
   values around the pixel to produce the new value.

Input:
   <infile>  The basename of the input data file
   <pixsize>  The desired pixel size in the output file.

Output:
   <outfile>  The basename of the output file.  The output file will contain
        <pixsize> sized pixels.
