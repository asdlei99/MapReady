NAME: spectra

SYNOPSIS: spectra [-x <startX>] [-y <startY>] <signal data>

DESCRIPTION:

    Spectra computes range and azimuth spectra of the input complex signal
    data file.  The spectra are written to the output files
    "spectra_range", and "spectra_az", which are 1024-line long ASCII files
    containing the (arbitrary-units) power of the signal data at freqencies
    between 0 Hz and the sampling frequency. In range, this is several tens
    of megahertz (18.96 MHz for ERS); in azimuth, this is about a thousand
    hertz (about 1700 Hz for ERS).

    Spectra is useful in checking signal data quality/validity, but most
    people have no reason to use it.

    Spectra's output files have the format:
       <FFT bin #> <power>
       <FFT bin #> <power>
       ...

OPTIONS:

    -y <startY>
       specifies that the signal spectra are to be computed starting at
       line startY instead of line 0.

    -x <startX>
	specifies that the signal spectra are to be computed starting at
	sample startX instead of sample 0.

EXAMPLES:
    > spectra -x 1000 -y 20000 E122175287S0C006

    Writes the azimuth and range spectra of the given ASF CEOS signal data
    at lines 20000-20123, samples 1000-2023 to the files spectra_az and
    spectra_range, respectively.
