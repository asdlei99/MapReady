NAME:
	quicklook

SYNOPSIS:
	quicklook [-k <nLooks>] [-q <quality>] [-a <aspect ratio>]
	          <input signal> <output image>

DESCRIPTION:
	Quicklook is a SAR Processor, like ardop.  Quicklook runs much more
	quickly than ardop, but generates a smaller, grainer output image. You
	can make the image slightly less grainy by using more looks (-k); and
	make the image bigger by using -q.
	
	Quicklook can read the signal format ardop reads -- raw data (.raw &
	.in).  Quicklook  does a poor job on satellites that aren't steered to
	zero doppler (RADARSAT).

OPTIONS:
	-k  controls the number of range looks taken on the data. More looks
	    takes more time, but generates a smoother output image (less
	    speckle).  The default is 4 looks.

	-q  controls the size of the FFTs quicklook uses.  Increasing q by 1
	    approximately double each dimension of the output image, but
	    quadruples the amount of time quicklook takes.  The default is 1,
	    which produces a 1300 sample by 800 line output image from a
	    full-frame of ERS signal data.

	-a  controls the aspect ratio of the output image.  This is the ratio of
	    the range FFT size to the azimuth FFT size.  Larger aspect ratios
	    make shorter, fatter images.  The default is 2, which produces only
	    slightly vertically stretched ERS-1 images.  The aspect ratio must
	    be a power of 2: 0.25,0.5,1,2,4,8,...

EXAMPLE:
	To produce a 1300x800 full-frame floating-point amplitude image
	e1_quick.img in about one minute, taking 4 radiometric looks, do:

	    > quicklook E122175287S0C006 e1_quick
