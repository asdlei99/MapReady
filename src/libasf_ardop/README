    README FILE FOR - ASF PROCESSOR (ARDOP)

    INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
    	  All of the code required to run this program has been included
	in the tar package that this file came in.

	  A large portion of the computational work in ARDOP takes place in
  	Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) routines.  To create a stand alone
  	application, a generic C FFT routine (zfft.c) and a calling routine
  	(cfft1d_nr.c) come with this program.  However, since FFTs are so
  	time consuming, another routine which utilizes IMSL FFTs
	(cfft1d_imsl.c) has also been included.  We have noted that the 
	IMSL FFTs require onlt about 60% of the time required by our zfft.c 
	routine (saving up to half an hour for a full image).  In order to
    	compile ASP, you need to determine which version you wish to run.

        OPTION 1: 
      	If you choose to use the NUMERICAL RECIPIES (ie. you don't have the
      	IMSL package), then from the asf_tools directory (not the 
      	asf_tools/src/ardop directory) just type "make ardop"

	OPTION 2:
	If you choose to use the IMSL version, you must first edit the file
	"make.solaris.imsl" (see below) in this directory.  Then from the
	asf_tools directory (not the asf_tools/src/ardop directory) install 
	the correct Makefile (see asf_tools/README) and type "make ardop_imsl"
	
    SITE SPECIFIC MODIFICATIONS:
	If your system has the IMSL package and you choose to use it, you
	will need to modfiy the file "Makefile.imsl" by changing the
	definition of ILIB to reflect your local path to the IMSL software.

    NOTES:
        To modify the processor to read other data types, read the file
        HOWTO_MODIFY.
