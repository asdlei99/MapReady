NAME:	accum_offset

SYNOPSIS:  accum_offset METAfile1 METAfile2 ...

	Accum_offset requires at least two meta files as parameters. Each meta
	file should be entered without any extensions (.dat, .ldr, .trl, and
	etc.) as accum_offset will add them as needed. The maximum number of
	files is equal to the number of arguments allowed by your machine.

DESCRIPTION:

	Accum_offset will take a list of metafiles and place them in ascending
	order by latitude. Accum_offset will take the first image and make it
	the anchor image. The upper left hand coordinates of this image are
	considered 1,1 (line,sample). Each succeeding image is then given 
	upper left hand coordinates relative to the first. 

	The last set of data is for those wanting to create a mosaic out of
	these images. Accum_offset will recalculate the sample position so 
	that the lowest sample number is equal to 1. The final two lines of
	output will be the total number of lines and samples in the new
	mosaic.

ERROR MESSAGES:
    MESSAGE GIVEN:				REASON:
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    		Messages are self-explanatory. The main source of error
		(besides not finding files and memory) is the mixing of low
		resolution and high resolution images. A set of images must
		have the same resolution.

		If a resolution cannot be determined, accum_offset will ask
		for it.

EXAMPLES: 
	Using the following low resolution META files, accum_offset will create
	the resulting output.

	Files:
	  23214200 (.dat, .trl, .ldr)
	  23215200 (.dat, .trl, .ldr)
	  23216200 (.dat, .trl, .ldr)
	  23217200 (.dat, .trl, .ldr)
	  23218200 (.dat, .trl, .ldr)
	
	Type on command line:
	  example% accum_offset 23214200 23215200 23216200 23217200 23218200
