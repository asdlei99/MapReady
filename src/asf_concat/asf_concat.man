NAME:		ASF_CONCAT.A

DESCRIPTION:	Library of LAS 6.0 support routines that have been ported
		to run without any TAE dependencies, but are used only
		by concat and concatm

CONTENTS:
This library contains the LAS 6.0 image I/O routines used 
only by concat and concatm.

The c_eopen and c_estep interface is complex and depricated-- 
use getFloatLine and putFloatLine (see asf_las).
