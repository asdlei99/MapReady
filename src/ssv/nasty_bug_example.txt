I forgot the line

	ec_lock_writer_unlock (field_lock);

near the end of table_file_field_writer_trylock() method in
table_file.c (the return case where the intraprocess lock worked and
the file lock didn't, so we have to unwind).  This was very hard to
detect and would have been far easier with the graphical system I'm
contemplating.
