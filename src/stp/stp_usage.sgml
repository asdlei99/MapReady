    <title>SAR Processing</title>
    <para>The SAR Training Processor (STP) will process level 0
      data to level 1 using ArDOP, ASF's own SAR processing tool.
      The ArDOP tool is run is an expanded mode where intermediate
      products can be made available for inspection, however the
      SAR processing that occurs is the same.</para>
    <para>To use the tool, the level 0 data needs to be imported
      into ASF's internal format first.  The asf_import tool, or
      the asf_mapready tool, will do this for you if your data isn't
      already in the proper format.</para>
    <para>To process the data, choose the "Browse" button and select
      the raw data file, and then select the "Execute" button.  The
      button label changes to "Processing..." while the processing
      occurs.  During processing, the terminal window will display
      the messages generated by ArDOP during the processing of your
      level 0 data.</para>
    <para>You may need to scroll vertically down in order to see
      the "Execute" button.</para>
    <para>When the processing completes, the "Execute" button reverts
      back, and you will have produced a level 1 product.</para>
    <para>Please note that the SAR Training Processor only processes
      the first patch of data.  If you are interested in studying
      a feature not in the first patch, you can use the "Start Line"
      option described below in the "Other Capabilities" section. </para>

  <chapter id="intermediates">
    <title>SAR Processing Intermediate Products</title>
    <para>To learn more about how ArDOP works, the SAR Processing
      procedure is divided into 12 steps, and they are listed in
      the main STP window.</para>
    <para>The first six steps are the "range compression," where
      the data is focused in the range direction, and the last six
      are the "azimuth compression," where the data is focused in
      the azimuth direction.</para>
    <para>Each step name has a small information icon next to it,
      clicking on this icon will bring up some information about
      that step, and how it fits into the full process.  This
      information appears to the right of the step list.</para>
    <para>Next to the information icon, there is a small magnifying
      glass icon, which is used to view the intermediate product
      at that step in the processing.  However, to view the product
      it needs to have been generated and saved during processing,
      and by default no intermediate products are saved.  To save
      one, the next button over needs to be toggled before the
      processing begins.</para>
    <para>In order to be able to see all of the intermediate
      products, you would need to turn on each of the intermediate
      product toggle buttons.  Or, you can use the "Select All
      Outputs" button, which is in the lower left corner of the
      window.  You may need to vertically scroll down in order to
      see this button.</para>
    <para>So, perhaps the simplest and best way to use the SAR
      Training Processor is to do this:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select a .RAW file to process</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Turn on all intermediate products by clicking
          the "Select All Outputs" button</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Click "Execute" to start processing.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>While processing occurs, you can read about
          each of the SAR Processing steps using the
          information icons.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>As processing progresses, and intermediate
          products are generated, the view button can be used
          to look at each intermediate.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>After processing completes, the final result
          can be viewed with the view button for the last
          step, Step 12.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <title>Other Capabilities</title>
    <para>The SAR Training processor only processes the
      first patch of data in the original file, instead of
      the entire file.  If there is a particular feature
      you are interested in studying that doesn't like in
      the first patch, you can use the "Start Line" entry
      to start somewhere else in the file.  Only one patch
      will be processed, but the patch's first line will
      be what you've requested.</para>
    <para>The doppler value used by ArDOP can be set using
      the "Change Doppler Parameters" button.  The values
      in the metadata are the defaults, you may change them
      if you wish to experiment.  Changing these values could
      result in failed SAR processing, however - for example,
      some doppler values could result in pulses that miss
      the Earth!</para>
