    NAME: fit_line

    SYNOPSIS: fit_line [-log <file>] [-quiet] <in> <out>

    DESCRIPTION:
    	fit_line is typically used during CCSD interferometry to clean
    up the output of fico.  It fits a scaling and translation matrix
    to the input offsets file in a least-squares sense.

    OPTIONS: 
    	 <in>  a fico point offset file
    	<out>  a offset file in calc-deltas compatible format:
    		 This file matches the <image 1> to <image 2>, as
    		 img2.x=img1.x+img1.x*<first number>+<second number>
    		 img2.y=img1.y+img1.x*<third number>+<fourth number>
[-log <file>]  Option to have output written to a log file.
     [-quiet]  Option to suppress the output to the essential.

    EXAMPLES:
	If you had previously run fico to generate "fico1", to generate
	a file for use with calc_deltas (called toLine), you would type:
	
		fit_line fico1 toLine
	
    SEE ALSO:
    	fico(1), calc_deltas(1)
