NAME:  reskew_dem

SYNOPSIS:  
    
    reskew_dem [-log <file>] <inGR_DEM> <outSR_DEM> <outSR_simAmp>

DESCRIPTION:

    Maps an input, ground range DEM into slant range, and creates a
    simulated SAR image.  The input DEM must already be lined up with the
    image, but need not be precisely co-registered. In fact, the amplitude
    image is generated only so the images can be co-registered.

    This program is called by dem2seeds.

OPTIONS:

    -log <file>  Option to have the output written to a log file.

EXAMPLES:

    reskew_dem elevation.dem elevation_sr.ht ampsim_sr.amp
    
    This will remap the input LAS file elevation.dem to the slant range LAS
    DEM elevation_sr.ht and the simulated amplitude image ampsim_sr.amp.
