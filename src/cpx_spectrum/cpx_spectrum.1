NAME:cpx_spectrum- Calculates the azimuthal spectrum of a complex image product 

SYNOPSIS:
  cpx_spectrum <complex img input> <azimuthal spectrum file> <start_line>

	<complex img input>		Input Complex Image
	<azimuthal spectrum file>	ASCII file containing the spectrum
	<start_line>			Line to begin processing at

    DESCRIPTION:

	This program is used to generate an azimuthal spectrum of
	a complex  SAR image  product.   Its  main use is for bandpass filtering
	of complex image data (see cpx_autofilter) .It takes a processed complex 
	image and calculates an average azimuthal spectrum over all the range
	samples.  It uses a simple one-dimensional FFT to calculate the 
	spectrum and outputs the frequency, amplitude, and phase an ASCII
	file for inspection.  The output file appends the extension .spectra
	to the end of the <azimuthal spectrum file> filename.
	The file format is:
	
	Column #
	1.  Frequency - All positive values.  The FFT has been examined from 0->fs
	where fs is the sampling frequency.  Standard FFT's generate data from 
	-fs/2->fs/2, but since this data is complex, there is no intrinsic symmetry
	so 0->fs is perfectly acceptable.  For ERS1-ERS2 fs~1679 Hz or 1 PRF.

	2.  Amplitude - The amplitude of the calculated spectrum.  This is a linear
	representation of the amplitude spectrum.
	
	3.  Phase - The phase of the calculated spectrum.  This field doesn't really
	appear to have much use, but was included for completeness.

		This file is very easy to view in a program such as Matlab or Excel.

EXAMPLES:
	Suppose you have an input image ers1.cpx, then to generate the
        azimuthal spectrum, the command line input would simply be:

	cpx_spectrum ers1.cpx ers1 0
