NAME: fit_quadratic

SYNOPSIS: fit_quadratic <in> <out>

DESCRIPTION:
    	fit_quadratic fits a least-squares planar quadratic mapping to the
    given input data.  This is a mapping of the form:
    	<out>=A + B*x + C*y + D*x*x + E*x*y + F*y*y
    
    A mapping is calculated which maps the input points (see below) to 
    the output points and back again.  Each mapping is written out.
    
    In addition, this program lists the fit error it finds for each point.

OPTIONS:
    	<in> an fico offset point file.  Contains pixel locations of type
    		<output X> <output Y> <input X> <input Y>
    		...
    
    	<out> a file in remap -quad compatible format:
    		The 6 quadratic coefficients above are stored for
    		  <input to output X>
    		  <input to output Y>
    		  <output to input X>
    		  <output to input Y>
    		in ABCDEFG order, as floating-point numbers.
