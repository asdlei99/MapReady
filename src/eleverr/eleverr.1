NAME:  eleverr -- generate DEM errors from coherence file

SYNOPSIS: eleverr [-i <init_err>] [-log <file>] [-mask <file>]
			<coherence> <base> <outfile>
	      

    <coherence>:  coherence file (from coh(1))
         <base>:  file containing baseline parameters.
	          format:  Bn_c   dBn   Bp_c   dBp 
      <outfile>:  output file containing one sigma errors.
	  
DESCRIPTION:

    Generate a slant range DEM error map from a coherence image and an
    unwrapped phase file.
    
OPTIONS:
	
	-i init_err:  error associated with seed elevation in meters.
	  		Default is 0.0 meters.
	-log <file>:  allows the output to be written to a log file.
	-mask <file>: mask file created by escher containg integration info.
