ERROR MESSAGES:
MESSAGE GIVEN:				REASON:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLES:

SEE ALSO:
 
HARDWARE/SOFTWARE LIMITATIONS:
   Change idtable so that it determines amount of memory needed at run time.
   I also assume just one banded images.
 
BUGS:
   At most the table can handle 80 table values.
   If image has more than one band, output ddr will be incorrect.
