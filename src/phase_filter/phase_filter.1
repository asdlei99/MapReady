NAME: phase_filter

SYNOPSIS: phase_filter <in> <strength> <out>

		    <in>    LAS 6.0 sigle-banded image (with extension)
		<strength>  is a real decimal number generally between 1.2
		            and 1.8
		    <out>   LAS 6.0 sigle_banded floating-point image.

DESCRIPTION:

	phase_filter applies the Goldstein phase filter
	to an interferometric phase image.

	The Goldstein phase filter consists of FFT'ing a 
	small piece of a phase image, raising the FFT'd data to
	some power (strength), and IFFT'ing the scaled image.  

	The idea is that the spectrum of a phase image
	contains some strong line components, and some white noise.
	But by exponentiating the spectrum, the strong line components
	get stronger (because their values are large) and the noise
	gets weaker (because its values are spread out and small).
	In this way, the signal (topography or motion) in a phase image
	is preferentially amplified over the noise (decorrelation).

	The filter actually works remarkably well, smoothing noise
	while keeping fringe lines sharp.  In addition, in a totally
	decorrelated area (water, or heavy vegetation) the filter 
	doesn't change the phase much, since there are no strong line
	components to the spectrum.  So meaningless-phase areas like
	lakes and layover regions STAY meaningless-- the filter doesn't
	extract a weak and misleading signal from them.

	The strength parameter works best between 1.3 and 1.6.
	Smaller values have little effect on the phase (values less than
	1.0 amplify the noise at the expense of the signal!), and larger
	values filter out small features in the phase image (values around
	2.0 result in very blocky, gothic-looking phase).

	An interpolation scheme lifted from Rob Fatland smooths
	the edges between small patches.

OPTIONS:
	The input must be a LAS 6.0 single-banded image (with 
	extension).  It can have any size or data type.  Its values will
	be wrapped to [-pi,pi); but needn't start out there.
	The output will be a LAS 6.0 single-banded floating-point
	image with the same size and type, but filtered phase.
	The strength is a real decimal number, almost always between
	1.2 and 1.8.

EXAMPLES:
	If you had a noisy, decorrelated phase image "ml.phase",
	you could filter it to produce "clean.phase" using:

	example> phase_filter ml.phase 1.3 clean.phase
