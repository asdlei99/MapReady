NAME: raster_diff

SYNOPSIS:
        raster_diff [mask value] [-d diff.ext] <img1.ext> <img2.ext>

DESCRIPTION:
        Compares two ASF tools format images. It then outputs a 
        histogram and summary of the differences, and if -d is 
        specified, an image containing (img1-img2).

        This is useful for comparing image files.

OPTIONS:
        -m mask 
            Specify a value in the comparison images to be ignored.
        -d diff.ext
            Create an image with pixels numerically equal to: 
              diff.ext = img1.ext - img2.ext

EXAMPLES:
        > raster_diff correct.img questionable.img
            Compares correct to questionable and prints out a summary 
            and histogram of the differences.
        
        > raster_diff -d difference.img correct.img questionable.img
            Creates an image "difference", whose pixels are equal to 
            (correct - questionable). If correct equals questionable, 
            then the pixels are (of course) zero.
