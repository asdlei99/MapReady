    NAME: refine_offset

    SYNOPSIS: refine_offset metadata ddr_file [ DJ# | locSpec ] y x 
    				[ [ DJ# | locSpec ] y x ] [...]

    DESCRIPTION:
          Refine_offset takes as input a set of points in a SAR image 
    whose latitude and longitude are known.  Using this, the 
    program refines the slant range and timing offset in 
    the .meta file, which improves the geolocation of the image.
    (for example, in demIFM(1) or geocode(1))
    
          We have to do this because the CEOS timing information is
    inaccurate, often by a large fraction of a second, in the
    along-track (azimuth) direction.
    
    	The timing and slant range compensations are written to
    the the given .meta file as "timeShift" and "slantShift",
    in seconds and meters.  Typically, the slant range values
    are very good, and the shift is only a few dozen meters.
    The timing offset is less predictable-- this value is 
    nominally about 0.25 seconds (half the synthetic aperture
    time), but can vary by as much as a half second
    (corresponding to 3 kilometers of geolocation error).
    
    	When the image point and latitude and longitude are
    accurate, you can expect sub-pixel geolocation accuracy
    (<10m).  If you pick the point incorrectly, or mis-type
    the latitude or longitude, the geolocations of the image
    will be correspondingly shifted.
    
    	It is not necessary, but may help to enter multiple
    points.  Using multiple points helps cancel out any
    random error that may be present in the latitudes and
    longitudes, or uncertainty in location. 


    OPTIONS: 
     metdata: image metadata, either .meta or .L
     elev: elevation of imaged point (meters-- default 0.0)
     ddr_file: Image from which the pixel positions were taken
     
     The position can be specified as:
     	DJ#: the number of a corner reflector in Delta Junction
     	     (e.g. 'DJ3')
     or as a lat/lon/elevation set (e.g. '63.45234/-145.398/527.5')
        lat: Image point latitude (decimal degrees)
        lon: Image point longitude (decimal degrees)
        elevation: height of point above ellipsoid (meters)
     
     y: line position of point in image (pixels)
     x: sample position of point in image (pixels)

    EXAMPLES:
        If you have a CCSD SAR image named "e1_amp.img", with
    metadata  "e1.meta", and you have picked out a mountain 
    peak or corner reflector in "e1_amp.img" at
    line 2314, sample 390; and you know the elevation of the
    object is 423.2 meters above the WGS-84 ellipsoid, and
    the latitude and longitude of the point is 63.458, -145.29:
    
    example1% refine_offset e1 e1_amp 63.458/-145.29/423.2 2314 390
    
    will improve the along-track geolocations of e1_amp by modifying
    the timing offset in "e1.meta".  If you later use geocode to
    register e1_amp to a map projection, you will find the geolocations
    are much better.
