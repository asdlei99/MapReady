NAME:
  makeddr  --  creates a ddr file from the command line.

SYNOPSIS:
  makeddr [<projection> <specific parameters> <ULn> <ULe> <LRn> <LRe> <pdist>]
	  [-log <file>] [-d <datum code] <filename> <nl> <ns> <type>
	  
DESCRIPTION: 
	Create a LAS 6.0 DDR (Data Descriptor Record) from the command line.
  This is only useful when you don't have a DDR already (which is actually
  pretty rare, but when you need one it's tough to get along without it).
  This might happen if you're importing data from an source that doesn't use
  LAS (the Land Analysis System).

  The required inputes are:
    filename	The created DDR is called "filename.ddr".
    nl		Describes an image with a height of nl lines.
    ns		Describes an image with a width of ns samples.
    type	The data types are:

	data type	Description
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	byte		unsigned 1 byte integer data
	short		signed 2 byte integer data
	long		signed 4 byte integer data
	float		IEEE 4 byte single-precision floating-point data
	double		IEEE 8 byte double-precision floating-point data


OPTIONS:
  -log	Option to have output written to a log <file>.

  -d	Option to specify a <datum code>
  	  The datum code is a predefined number describing the eccentricity
	  of the earth. Here is a table:

  -p	Option to specify the type of projection to interpret the associated
	  image with. If you need to do any geographic analysis with the data,
	  you will need to enter geolocation information as well.  This is
	  done via optional command line parameters.  All projections require
	  the following information:

	Projection type			(Described below)
	Projection parameters		(Described below)
        ULn				Upper Left Northing Coordinate
        ULe				Upper Left Easting Coordinate
        LRn				Lower Right Northing Coordinate
        LRe				Lower Right Easting Coordinate
        pdist				Projection Distance (units per pixel)

	NOTE: ULn, ULe, LRn, LRe, and pdist units are meters for all
		projections except GEOGRAPH in which case they are in degrees

	Projection |		Parameters			| Units
	-----------+--------------------------------------------+-----
	  GEOGRAPH | N/A					| N/A
	  PLSTEREO | Standard Parallel, Central Meridian	| degrees
	       UTM | Zone					| Zone number
	  LAMAZEQA | Central Latitude, Central Longitude,	| degrees
		   |	Radius of reference sphere		| meters
	    ALBERS | 1st Standard Parallel, 2nd Std Parallel,	| degrees
		   |	Central Meridian			| degrees


EXAMPLES:
     1)	If you want to make a ddr for a floating-point image named "bob.amp"
        with dimensions of 100 lines by 20 samples, type:
	
	makeddr bob 100 20 float
	
	And the program will create a 1-band DDR named "bob.ddr".

     2) If you want to make a ddr for a unsigned 2-byte int image named
	"mydem.img" with dimensions of 7480 lines by 5911 samples, 
	geolocations of Upper Left (6652899.87North, 440890.23East) and
  	Lower Right (6428499.87North, 618220.23East) in UTM Zone 8 at 
	30.0 meter pixel spacings, type:

	makeddr  -p UTM 8 6652899.87 440890.23 6428499.87 618220.23 30.0 \
	  mydem 7480 5911 short

	(don't type the '\' it is there only to signify a wrapped line)

	And the program will create a 1-band int*2 DDR named "mydem.ddr"
	with valid projection information.

     3) If you want to make a ddr for a 8 byte floating point image
        using a Geographic projection with dimensions 4096 lines by
	2000 samples, geolocations of Upper Left (65.5north -146.0east)
	and Lower Right (65.0north -145.0east), and 10.0 meter pixel
	spacing, type:
	
        makeddr -p GEOGRAPH 65.5 -146.0 65.0 -145.0 10.0 mydem 4096 2000 \
	  double
        
        (don't type the '\' it is there only to signify a wrapped line)

        And the program will create a 1-band real*8 DDR named "mydem.ddr"
        with valid projection information.
