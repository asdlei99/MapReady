    NAME: fit_warp

    SYNOPSIS: fit_warp <in> <image> <out>

    DESCRIPTION:
    	
    	fit_warp finds a weighted combination of the point offsets
    from fico to generate two output translation LAS images--
    out.horiz and out.vert.  These can be fed to the "-warp" option
    in remap.
    
       The resulting warping images can represent a non-linear 
    image-image shift, which may result in much higher phase
    coherence for interferometry over moving and deforming surfaces,
    such as glaciers or ice sheets.
    

    OPTIONS:
    	<in> an fico offset point file
    	<image> is a LAS image, used to set the size of the offset files.
    	     Otherwise, it is unused.
    	<out> the base name for the warp image files.
    	     out.horiz will the be the horizontal warping offset image;
    	     out.vert will be the vertical warping offset image.

    EXAMPLES:
	If you had previously performed a correlation with
	fico to generate "fico1", to generate files for 
	use with remap (called warped.horiz and warped.vert)
	on the image "remapThis", you would type:
	
		fit_warp fico1 remapThis warped
	
	You could later line remapThis up with:
		remap -warp warped -sameSize remapThis out
	
    SEE ALSO:
    	fico(1), remap(1), compare to fit_plane(1).

    HARDWARE/SOFTWARE LIMITATIONS: none
