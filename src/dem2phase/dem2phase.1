.TH dem2phase 1 "6/98"
.SH NAME:
dem2phase \- produce a simulated phase file from slant-range elevation file
.SH SYNOPSIS:
.B "dem2phase " 
.BI "<sr_dem> <metadata> <base> <phase> [-log <file>]"
.SH DESCRIPTION:
.B "dem2phase"
Simulates the phase of an interferogram, given a slant-range height
image.  The baseline and ceos files are used to generate the 
coefficients of the equation used to calculate height from a phase 
signal. 
.PP
The output file is a float file of the same dimensions as the input file. 
Each value will be a phase in radians or 0 if the region has no DEM.
.PP
.TP 8
.B "<sr_dem>"
Input slant-range height file. This file is generated by 
.BR reskew_dem (1).
.TP 8
.B "<base>"
Baseline file. ASCII file of 4 baseline parameters entered on the same line.
This file is usually created by 
.BR resolve (1)
or 
.BR refine_base (1).
The user can also fine-tune these values by hand. The 4 values are, in order,
perpendicular baseline (Bn), delta perpendicular baseline (dBn), parallel
baseline (Bp), and delta parallel baseline (dBp). The delta values represent
the change of the baseline over the entire image.
.TP 8
.B "<metadata>"
Name of file containing metadata (the .meta file) for imageA (source image)..
.TP 8
.B "<phase>"
Name of file to contain output simulated phase.
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:
.TP 8
.B "-log <file>"
Option to have output written to a log file.
.SH EXAMPLES:
.ce 1
example% dem2phase elev12.ht asc1 base.1 sim_phase 
.PP
Creates the file sim_phase.phase from the slant-range height file elev12.ht. 
Asc1.meta is the name of the metadata file connected with the source image.
