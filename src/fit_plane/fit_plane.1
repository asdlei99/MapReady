    NAME: fit_plane

    SYNOPSIS: fit_plane [-k <keepFraction>] [-log <file>] <in> <out>

    DESCRIPTION:
    	fit_plane is used to clean up the output of fico.
    	
    	fit_plane performs a weighted planar least-squares regression 
    on the output of fico to generate an output file in remap-compatible 
    format.  This allows for any combination of translate, scale, rotate, 
    and shear transformations.
    
    	It performs point elimination, to throw out points which do not
    agree well with the fit.

    OPTIONS:
    	<in> an fico offset point file
    	<out> a matrix file in remap compatible format:
    		This file matches the <image 1> to <image 2>, as
    		img1.x=img2.x*<first number>+img2.y*<second number>+<third number>
    		img1.y=img2.x*<fourth number>+img2.y*<fifth number>+<sixth number>
    	
    	k <keepFraction> Specify the fraction of points to keep in fit.
    	        The default is 0.80-- keep 80% of the given points.
	-log <file>  Option to have the output written to a log file.
    	
    EXAMPLES:
	If you had previously performed a correlation with
	fico to generate "fico1", to generate a file for 
	use with remap (called matrixFile), you would type:
	
		fit_plane fico1 matrixFile
	
    SEE ALSO:
    	fico(1), remap(1), compare to fit_line(1).
