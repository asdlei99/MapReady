NAME:
     auto_sar_mosaic - create a single mosaic from  two  or  more
     SAR images

SYNOPSIS:

     auto_sar_mosaic [-c] [-h] [-p pixel_size] [ -i] [-f fill]
            projfile projkey output_file <input files...>


DESCRIPTION:
     auto_sar_mosaic will assemble SAR CEOS images, from any swath
     or frame, into a large mosaic in LAS format. 

OPTIONS:
     -h      Create a color image.  The  first  picture  will  be
             red,  the next green, the next blue, cycling through
             red again.

     -c      Specifying this option will prevent  auto_sar_mosaic
             from performing a radiometric calibration of the SAR
             data. 

     -p pixel_size
             Set output pixel size to pixel_size meters. 

     projfile
             Projection file used for geocoding.

     projkey
             Projection key used for geocoding.

     -i      Create an imageid mosaic.
             An image id mosaic is a mosaic that has the same out-
             line as the image, but each  pixel  has a value that
             corresponds  to  the  id  of the image where it ori-
             ginated.
     
     -f fill
             Fills the background of the images with fill (default zero).

     output_file
             Specify the output file  name. This is a LAS image
             that auto_sar_mosaic will create.

     input_file
	     SAR CEOS images

ERROR MESSAGES:
    MESSAGE GIVEN:				REASON:
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLES:
     This command will combine the SAR CEOS images E1203, E1923,
     and E1935 into a combined LAS image "mosaic.img".  The
     projection file is "polar.proj" (created using projprm)
     and projection key is "ps1".

            example% auto_sar_mosaic polar.proj ps1 mosaic \
            			E1203 E1923 E1935

     Works exactly as above, but the data is  not  calibrated  before
     performing the mosaic.

          example% auto_sar_mosaic -c polar.proj ps1 mosaic \
            			E1203 E1923 E1935

     All of the above examples would  have  created  a  mosaic
     image.  To  create  an  imageid mosaic, you would have to add
     the -i option.

HARDWARE/SOFTWARE LIMITATIONS:
     A projection file must be created before running  this  pro-
     gram.  Use the projprm(1) program to create such a file.  
     See  projprm  for  more details.
