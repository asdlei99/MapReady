    NAME: coh - Calculates interferogram coherence 

    SYNOPSIS: coh [-look linexsamp] [-step linexsample]
                  <In1> <In2> <Out>

       In1   is the image 1 complex file
       In2   is the image 2 complex file
       Out   is a floating-point coherence file (.coh).


    DESCRIPTION:

            This program is used after interferometry has been 
        performed in order to generate a coherence image-- a
        black and white image whose brightness corresponds to
        the quantity of variation (rho) observed in the
        interferogram. This rho can then be used to distinguish 
        between different features on the ground (especially 
        useful when those features have the same radar brightness),
        as well as give a quantitative evaluation of how
        sucessful the interferometry was.
        
            This program operates on the raw interferogram,
        before multilooking (i.e. before the ml(1) program),
        because it performs multilooking as it computes rho.
        It defaults to reading the ddr to get the number of
        lines and samples in an image.  All filenames are
        without extentions.
        
        Coh calculates the coherence for the Igram using the following
        formula:
         
                             | Sum (n pixels) { a x b* } |
          | rho | =    __________________________________________

                       Sqrt [ Sum { |a x a*| }  Sum { |b x b*| } ]
        
        In this program n = 20 pixels: 10 in azimuth x 2 in range.

        
    OPTIONS:
      -look   change look box line and sample.
      -step   change step box line and sample.


    EXAMPLES:
        If you've just run "igram img1 img2 interferogram"
        and you want to generate a coherence image bob.coh, type:
            $ coh img1 img2 interferogram bob

        If you would like to specifiy your own look window to 15
        lines by 3 samples and your step increment to 5 lines by 1
        sample, then you would use this command line:
            $ coh -look 15x3 -step 5x1 img1 img2 interferogram bob
