NAME: dem2seeds

SYNOPSIS: 

	dem2seeds [-b] [-log <file>] <inDEM> <inAmp> <outSeeds>

DESCRIPTION:
	
	<inDEM>: this is an input DEM image.  It must be a valid LAS image,
                 and if the seeds are for use with tandem_ifm, it should 
                 be slant range.

	<inAmp>: this is the input SAR amplitude image.  The seed points
                 are written relative to this image.
        
     <outSeeds>: list of seed points (x, y, height) found in DEM.
	  	 The output file is in tandem_ifm format:
		 <seed x> <seed y> <seed height> in meters.
        
     This program searches the specified DEM for seed points.  The seed
   points are selected on the basis of their flat surroundings and
   well-distributed-ness.

OPTIONS:
   -b:   Search for seed points based on *maximal* local slope;
            as opposed to *minimal* local slope.

   -log: Allows the output to be written to a log file
