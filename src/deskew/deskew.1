   deskew

Usage:
   deskew <input file> <input metadata file> <output file> <output metadata file>
             [-license] [-version] [-help]

Description:
   Deskew removes squint-induced skew from ground range images.
   The squint angle of an image along with the look angle is used
   to determine the amount of parallelogram shift skew that has
   been introduced in an image due to the doppler centroid selection
   during image processing.  It then remaps the image, using a bi-
   linear interpolation, to remove this skew.

Input:
   <input file>  An ASF Internal format file (.img, .ddr) that has
        not been deskewed (check the 'deskewed:' flag in the metadata
        file sar block)
   <input metadata file>  The metadata file that is associated
        with the input file.

Output:
   <output file>  An ASF Internal format file (.img, .ddr) that
        has been deskewed.
   <output metadata file>  The metadata file associated with the
        output file.
