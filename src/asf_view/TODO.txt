1. The size of the cache is still arbitrary at 1GB.  Need to be able to
   use a larger cache if possible, and a smaller one if necessary.

2. A "Settings" tab would be nice.  Some ideas for what goes in here:

   a.  Choose what color the crosshairs/lines are.
   b.  Select how the data is mapped from floating points to bytes.  We
       currently only do 2-sigma.

3. The histogram doesn't look good for raw ceos data, since it only has
   a subset of the full 0-256 range.  So, the histogram looks sparse.
   I'm not sure how to best solve this problem.  Make the bars wider,
   when this situation is detected?  Make the histogram shorter? Of course,
   the vertical spacing needs to be uniform, so we can't just shrink out
   the zero sections.

4. ASF Internal format data that is byte is stored with bytes -- do this
   also with raw CEOS.
   
5. When viewing ALOS CEOS data, allow switching/combining bands, too.
