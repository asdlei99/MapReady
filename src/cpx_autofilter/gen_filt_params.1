NAME:	gen_filt_params - Generate filter parameters for cpx_filter

SYNOPSIS:  gen_filt_params <complex img1> <complex img2> <out_filt_params>

		*no extensions are required for this program*
		*the program looks for a .spectra file for both images*

	<complex img1>      Complex Input image 1
	<complex img2>      Complex Input image 2
	<out_filt_params>   Output file containing filter parameters

DESCRIPTION:
		In order to automate the cpx_filtering routine, a method needs 
	to exist to estimate the stopband, passband, and frequency shift 
	applied to the complex image pair automatically.  gen_filt_params
	performs this task.  It takes both complex image files as input and
	using the metadata and the azimuthal spectra, estimates the passband
	and the frequency shift.  The output file has the following format in 
	ASCII text:

	line 1.	frequency shift (in Hertz)
	line 2. loFreq1 hiFreq1 (in Hertz)
	line 3. loFreq2 hiFreq2 (in Hertz)

		The frequency shift simply specifies the amount both spectra
	should be shifted to return them both to baseband.  The first pair of
	frequency specifications indicates the first stopband, the second pair
	specifies the second stopband (There are potentially two stopbands 
	depending on how the spectra wrapped around the 1 PRF sampling
	frequency).

EAMPLES:
	Suppose you have an input image ers1.cpx and another input image
	ers2.cpx then to generate the filter parameter files, the command line 
	input would be:
	
		gen_filt_params ers1 ers2 params
