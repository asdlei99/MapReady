# NAME: cpx_autofilter - Automatic complex image bandpass filter
#
# SYNOPSIS:
#
#    cpx_autofilter <cpx in_img1> <cpx in_img2> <cpx out_img1> <cpx out_img2>
#
#        <cpx in_img1>           Complex Input Image 1
#        <cpx in_img2>           Complex Input Image 2
#        <cpx out_img1>          Complex Output Image 1
#        <cpx out_img2>          Complex Output Image 2
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
#        cpx_autofilter will attempt to improve interferogram coherence
#        by filtering the complex images in azimuth.
#
#        It does this by calculating the frequencies at which at azimuthal
#        spectrum contains information in both images.  It then builds a
#        bandpass filter, allowing only those frequencies with information
#        to pass.
#
#        Finally, the program examines the metadata of both images and
#        determines the processed doppler frequencies.  Using these values, the
#        images are shifted by a common modulation frequency which is just the
#        negative average of the two dopplers.  This operation essentially
#        translates the data to baseband, removing any doppler carrier that
#        may have existed in the datasets.
#
#                cpx_autofilter is actually a script that sequentially calls
#        the following programs:
#
#        1.      cpx_spectrum - generates a spectrum for each of the two complex
#                images before the filtering
#
#        2.      gen_filt_params - generates the filtering parameter file which
#                tells the program pcpx_filter what information to keep and what
#                information to throw away.
#
#        3.      cpx_filter - program is used to implement the filtering of the 
#  		 data in azimuth.
#
#        4.      cpx_spectrum - generate a spectrum for each of the two complex
#                images after the filtering operation has taken place.
