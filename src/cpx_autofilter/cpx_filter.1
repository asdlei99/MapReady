NAME:	cpx_filter - Bandpass filters complex image data in azimuth

SYNOPSIS:	cpx_filter <complex image input.cpx> <complex image output>
		<frequency parameter file>

	<complex image input.cpx>	Input Complex Image
	<complex image output>		Output Complex Image
	<frequency parameter file>	File containing passband information

DESCRIPTION:
	Complex images are usually processed using an optimal doppler,
	which is ideal for that particular image.  This means that when 
	interferometry is attempted with two different complex images, the 
	azimuthal spectra will not overlap completely.  The part of the spectra 
	that is outside	the overlapping bands contributes noise in the resulting
	inteferogram.  The overall phase coherence of the interferogram can be 
	improved by removing the components of the azimuthal spectrum 
	which do not overlap.
		
	This program filters the complex image data in an attempt to
	improve coherence in interferograms.  Complex data that is processed
	at a doppler different then that of the optimal doppler will exhibit a
	decreased coherence in interferometry.  This coherence can be improved
	by filtering the data in azimuth and retaining only the part of the two
	dataset's spectra that overlap.  The two datasets are then time-domain
	demodulated to baseband by the mean of their two doppler centroids.
	Another program 'cpx_spectrum' generates an azimuthal spectrum of
	the data.
	The frequency parameter file indicates which frequencies should be
	filtered.  This can be generated using the program gen_filt_params.

EXAMPLES:
	Suppose you have an input image ers1.cpx, then to filter the data,
	the command line input would be:
	
	cpx_filter ers1.cpx ers1_filtered params
