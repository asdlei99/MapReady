NAME:	cpx_autofilter - Automatic complex image bandpass filter

SYNOPSIS:	

    cpx_autofilter <cpx in_img1> <cpx in_img2> <cpx out_img1> <cpx out_img2>

	<cpx in_img1>		Complex Input Image 1
	<cpx in_img2>		Complex Input Image 2
	<cpx out_img1>		Complex Output Image 1
	<cpx out_img2>		Complex Output Image 2

DESCRIPTION:
	
	cpx_autofilter will attempt to improve interferogram coherence
        by filtering the complex images in azimuth.

	It does this by calculating the frequencies at which at azimuthal
	spectrum contains information in both images.  It then builds a 
	bandpass filter, allowing only those frequencies with information
	to pass.  

	Finally, the program examines the metadata of both images and
	determines the processed doppler frequencies.  Using these values, the
	images are shifted by a common modulation frequency which is just the
	negative average of the two dopplers.  This operation essentially
	translates the data to baseband, removing any doppler carrier that 
	may have existed in the datasets.

		cpx_autofilter is actually a script that sequentially calls 
	the following programs:

	1.	cpx_spectrum - generates a spectrum for each of the two complex
		images before the filtering

	2.	gen_filt_params - generates the filtering parameter file which
		tells the program pcpx_filter what information to keep and what
		information to throw away.

	3.	cpx_filter - program is used to implement the filtering of the
		data in azimuth.

	4.	cpx_spectrum - generate a spectrum for each of the two complex
		images after the filtering operation has taken place.

EXAMPLES:
		
	Suppose that you have two complex images, processed using different
	doppler centroids and you want to increase the coherence of the
	interferogram.
	The command line to perform this task using cpx_autofilter is as
	follows.
	cpx_autofilter ers1.cpx ers2.cpx ers1_filtered ers2_filtered

	This command would produce two complex images, ers1_filtered.cpx and
	ers2_filtered.cpx that have been filtered and basebanded.l
