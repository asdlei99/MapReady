.TH deramp 1 "April 1, 1999"
.SH NAME:
deramp \- produce a deramped phase file from an igram phase file.
.SH SYNOPSIS:
.B "deramp" 
.BI "[-backward] [-log <file>] <inphase> <meta> <baseline> <outphase>"
.SH DESCRIPTION:
.B "Deramp"
removes the phase signal imposed on the interferogram as a consequence of
the physical separation between the two constituent satellite passes,
called the baseline. The program operates by taking an assumed baseline
function and calculating the consequent 'baseline driven' phase at each
pixel. This phase is subtracted from the interferogram phase and the
resulting 'deramped' phase is written as the output file. 
.PP
The user can either generate the baseline by hand or use the file
generated by 
.BR resolve (1). 
Normally, deramp is run by 
.BR tandem_ifm(1).

.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:
.TP 8
.B "inphase"
Input phase file that has not been deramped. This file is generated by 
.BR igram (1).
.TP 8
.B "meta"
Name of file containing metadata (.meta file) for imageA. 
.TP 8
.B baseline
Baseline file. ASCII file of 4 baseline parameters entered on the same line.
This file is usually created by 
.BR resolve (1)
or 
.BR bp (1).
The user can also fine-tune these values by hand. The 4 values are, in order,
perpendicular baseline (Bn), delta perpendicular baseline (dBn), parallel
baseline (Bp), and delta parallel baseline (dBp). The delta values represent
the change of the baseline over the entire image.
.TP 8
.B "outphase"
Name of file to contain output phase file.
.TP 8
.B "-backward"
Perform deramping "backwards"-- this adds the baseline-induced
curvature back into the phase image, instead of subtracting it out.
.TP 8
.B "-log <file>"
Allows the output to be written to a log file.

.PP
.B "Deramp"
will adjust the phase to \fIifm100200.phase\fP and place the output in
\fIdifm100200.phase\fP. The baseline information will be read from
\fIfoo.base\fP. The CEOS metadata will be taken from the imageA metadata
files, either the .ldr/.trl combination or the newer .L/.D combination.
