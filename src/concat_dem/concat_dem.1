NAME: concat_dem

SYNOPSIS:

	concat_dem <out img.ext> <in img1.ext> [ <in img2.ext> [...]]
	 	
		<out img.ext>  Name of LAS 6.0 image to be created.
		<in img...>  single-banded LAS images.

DESCRIPTION:
	Concat_dem combines the input images to create an output image,
respecting the geolocations of each image.  It will translate the images 
so they line up with one another, but not rotate or flip them
(for that, use the geocode(1) program).

	Where several input images overlap, concat_dem combines them
by finding the trimmed average of their values, as described below.

	Unlike concat(1), concat_dem did not begin life as a LAS tool.
Concat_dem works best with Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), while
concat is aimed at SAR images.


OPTIONS:
	The output.ext parameter is the name of a LAS 6.0 image to be created.
The pixels of the output image are a trimmed mean of the pixels of the
input images-- the algorithm used for each output pixel is:
	-find the average value of all non-zero input pixels
	-throw out pixels that differ by more than 60m from the average
	-re-average remaining values

	The input images can be any sort (byte, short, float, long) of 
single-banded LAS images in any LAS projection, but they must all
be in the same map projection and have the same pixel size.

EXAMPLES:
  
  >concat_dem output.dem in1.img in2.img in3.img
Finds the trimmed average of in1, in2, and in3, which need not
cover exactly the same ground area.
