NAME: genab

SYNOPSIS: genab <seeds> <base> <meta> <A> <b>

DESCRIPTION:
	Genab is called by refine_base, and only refine_base.
	
	    Genab is used during the process of baseline refinement
	to generate the matrix A and vector b (hence the name: gen A b)
	for use with bp(1).  
	
	    It uses a tie point file and the CEOS metadata to do so.
 
OPTIONS:
	<seeds>: data file containing elevation, tie point, & phases
		 format:  indx    x    y    z    uwp
	<base>:  file containing baseline params. used to unwrap
	         format:  Bn_c   dBn   Bp_c   dBp
	
	<meta>:  the name of the file that contains the
	         metadata for image 1 of the interferogram pair.
	<A>:     output matrix (for bp(1))
	<b>:     output vector (for bp(1))
