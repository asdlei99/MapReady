.TH convert2byte 1 "April 2003"

.SH NAME:
convert2byte \- convert any ASF image file into a byte image.

.SH SYNOPSIS:
.B convert2byte
.I "[-multilook] [-look lxs] [-step lxs]"
.in 18
.I "[-log <logFile>] [-quiet]"
.B "<inFile> <outFile>"
.in -18

.SH DESCRIPTION:
.B "Convert2byte"
converts an ASF image file from any non-complex data type to a byte image. It is
a replacement for the former ASF tools amp2img and ui2byte. Use the
\-\fRmultilook\fP option to immitate amp2img's behavior. You do not need to use
any option to accomplish that which ui2byte used to do.
.PP
When the -multilook, -look, or -step options are used,
.B "convert2byte"
also decreases the image dimensions by performing a box average on some number
of pixels. For ERS-1 the box is often some multiple of 5x1 in order to produce
multilooked pixels with near-unity aspect ratio. Whereas
.B "ml(1)"
turns an interferogram (both amplitude and phase) into an image, 
.B "convert2byte"
creates an image that resembles the landscape. This image can give the 
user an idea of the ground/area in the interferogram.

.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:
.TP 8
.B "-multilook"
Multilook the data as it is converted to byte. This option uses look_count from
the meta file to figure the number of look and step lines (only if the data has
not already been multilooked). The number of look and step samples defaults to
1.
.TP 8
.B "-look \fRlxs\fP"
Change number of look lines and samples. (-multilook is implied.) If \-step is
specified, but \-look is not, then \-look defaults to the same values as \-step
is set to.
.TP 8
.B "-step \fRlxs\fP"
Change number of step lines and samples. (-multilook is implied.) If \-look is
specified, but \-step is not, then \-step defaults to the same values as \-look
is set to.
.TP
.B "-log \fRlogFile\fP"
Copies the terminal output and appends it to file\f logFile\fP.
.TP
.B "-quiet"
Suppresses the terminal output to the essential.
.TP
.B "inFile"
Input SAR file, extension included. Usually the output of igram(1).
.TP 8
.B "outFile"
Output image, without extension (although you may include it if you like).

.SH EXAMPLES:
Convert real.img to byte.img.
.PP
.ce 1
example% convert2byte real.img byte.img
.PP
Convert the amplitude file ifm1.amp into an image file named fred.img. Do so
using look lines equivalent to the ifm1.meta file's look_count field and a look
sample of 1. Step line and sample are the same as look line and sample.
.PP
.ce 1
example% convert2byte \-multilook ifm1.amp fred
.PP
Same as above except change the look area to 10 rows and 2 cols. Since \-step is
not specified, it is set to the same thing as \-look is.
.PP
.ce 1
example% convert2byte \-look 10x2 ifm1.amp fred
.PP
Say you have some noisy SAR data. You may want to try using a larger look area
while keeping the stepping distance normal as follows:
.PP
.ce 1
example% convert2byte \-look 10x2 \-step 5x1 ifm1.amp fred

.SH NOTES:
None.
