NAME:  creat_dem_grid

SYNOPSIS: 

    create_dem_grid [-log <file>] <las DEM> <las SAR> <SAR Ceos> <out_grid>
	
DESCRIPTION:
	
	During interferometry, it is necessary to clip out a piece of
	a map-registered DEM so the DEM is lined up with the SAR image.  This
	program is the first step in lining up the DEM.

	The program outputs a file containing pixel offsets for
	each input point.  This file can be read by the fit_plane(1) program,
	and that program's output used to move the image with remap(1).

	<las DEM> A LAS 6.0 DEM to create a grid upon
	<las SAR> a LAS 6.0 SAR file for which to create the grid
	<SAR Ceos> the ASF metadata file for the SAR file
	<out_grid> a mapping grid, for use with fit_plane-
	
OPTIONS:
	-log <file> allows the output to be written to a log file
