NAME:
    deskew_dem

SYNOPSIS:
    deskew_dem [-i <inSARfile> <bit>] [-log <file>] <inDEMfile> <outfile>

DESCRIPTION:
    This program removes incidence-angle skew and maps from slant range to
    ground range. It will do this to a DEM or SAR image. If the -i option is not
    specified, the input DEM will be converted from slant range to ground range
    and output to outfile. If the -i option is specified, deskew_dem will remove
    the height distortion from the SAR image inSARfile. If the <bit> is 1, the
    image will be both radiometrically and geometrically corrected for local
    slope. This behavior can be eliminated by using 0 for <bit>, which will only
    be corrected geometrically.

      <inDEMfile>  IEEE float slant-range dem, with extension .ht or .dem.
      <outfile>    Output image. If <outfile> has the extension .dem or .ht,
                    deskew_dem will convert the input slant-range DEM to ground
                    range.

OPTIONS:
    -i <inSARfile> <bit>
       If the <inSARfile> has the extension of .img or .amp, deskew_dem will
       output a terrain-corrected amplitude image, based on the input file
       <inDEMfile>.  If <bit> is 0, then the terrain correction is only
       geometric-- no radiometric incidence angle normalization will occur.
       Enter <bit> as 1 for this to happen.

    -log <file>
       This switch copies the standard output to a log file.

EXAMPLES:
    > deskew_dem elevation_sr.ht elevation.dem
       This will remap the input file elevation_sr.ht to the ground range DEM
       elevation.dem.

    > deskew_dem -i input.amp 1 elevation.dem out.amp
       This will remove radiometric and geometric distortion from the input
       slant range image input.amp and create out.amp.

    > deskew_dem -i input.amp 0 elevation.dem out.amp
       Same as above, but only geometric distortion is removed (no radiometric
       distortion is removed-- hence the front slopes of mountains will be
       brighter than the back slopes).
