SAR Training Processor (STP) Version History


SAR Training Processor (STP) 1.1.10
Released 2009 January 9

* Enable the window to be sized smaller than it's startup dimensions.
* Remove spurious warnings when ASF View is started from the STP interface.
* Use PNGs instead of JPEGs as the intermediate image files.
* Improved portability by no longer relying on the Cygwin library in the
  Win32 distribution.



SAR Training Processor (STP) 1.1.6
Released 2008 July 23

* Streamlined the way STP generates the JPEG intermediate images,
  so STP should run faster & use less memory.
* Vertically shrunk the GUI, so that the "Execute" button is not
  off the bottom of the screen in 1024x768.
* Fixed spurious "Invalid UTF8 string" warning.
* Added a button to view the debug images with ASF View.
* Added processing updates.  The Step currently being executed
  is red, and completed steps (where the debug images can be
  viewed) are bolded.
* Added the import functionality from MapReady to STP, so that
  a user may choose a Level 0 .raw file, or an STF .000 file
  directly in STP (without having to run MapReady first).
* Added an "Abort" button to halt processing.
* Added a "Clear" button, to remove intermediate files and the
  generated debug JPEGs.
* Upgraded the installer for better integration with MapReady
* Improved build system for source builds


SAR Training Processor (STP) 1.0.13
Initial release: 2006 October 30

The Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) has developed a SAR Training
Processor (STP).  This program is a synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
processor integrated with a graphical user interface (GUI) and is
built for use in the ASF SAR training courses. The STP assists users 
who are either new to SAR or who want a more in-depth knowledge of
SAR processing to learn what happens when a raw SAR image is processed
from Level 0 raw data to a Level 1 image via the range-Doppler
technique.  The STP has built-in hooks that allow images to be written
at each processing stage, giving the user an insider's view of
intermediate steps in the process. The GUI allows the user to choose
important parameters as well as which SAR processing steps to perform
in order to see the affects of each. It explains each step and
displays the imagery produced. With this capability at their
fingertips, users are able to better understand the significance of
each step in the range-Doppler SAR processing technique.
