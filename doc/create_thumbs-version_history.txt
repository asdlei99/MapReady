Create Thumbs Version History

Create Thumbs 2.0.5 (unleashed 2009 April 21)
Bug Fixes
- When processing Level 0 STF format RSAT data
  errors for 'Cannot find CEOS format file' would
  occur when exporting to JPEG.

Create Thumbs 2.0.4 (released 2009 April 17)
New Functionality
- Added L1.1 SLC support (produces a single amplitude
  thumbnail or browse image)
Bug Fixes
- Given a data set from ALOS, was producing a
  thumbnail for every file, i.e. LED-, IMG-, etc.

Create Thumbs 2.0.2 (released 2008 December 09)
Bug Fixes
- Some output images were scaled to sizes a lot
  smaller than requested with -size option (noting
  that the requested maximum size is a limit, not
  a guaranteed exact result ...resampling gets
  close but not exact.)
- Multiple results were produced for ALOS images, i.e. one
  for the VOL- file, the TRL- file, the LED- file, as well
  as all of the IMG- files.  Now only produces results for
  the IMG- files (one for each band.)
- If the output folder is the same as the data folder and
  create_thumbs were run twice, 'read past end of file'
  errors could occur.

Create Thumbs 2.0.1 (released 2008 October 28)
New Functionality
- Added support for JAXA Level 0 (AVNIR-2) data

Bug Fixes
- Fixed crash occurring when processing swaths whose
  acquisition time spanned midnight
