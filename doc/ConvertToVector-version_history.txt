Initial public release:
Convert To Vector 2.0.4
2008 July 30
ASF releases a light duty software kit, Covert to Vector. This tool transforms
point or scene information to various other formats that are compatible with
external applications such as Google Earth(tm), GIS software such as
ArcGIS(tm), text editors, and spreadsheets. One of the primary purposes of this
software is to enable users to quickly and easily view the extents of a SAR
dataset or a metadata file. This is done simply by dropping the file in
question into the Convert to Vector tool which can automatically detect the
data type, create a new file based on the available data, and open that file
in Google Earth to display the image boundaries. Of course, other
transformations are possible; all the tool needs is latitude and longitude
information.
