README file--  Answers the question: 

 "What the heck is going on in asf_tools/make_support/ ?"

    Here at ASF, we have a top-level Makefile sitting
in asf_tools which calls each individual program's
makefile.  This file has to know about each program's
name, directory, and need for libraries.  In addition,
in autotar, we have a script called tarfile which will
automatically tar up the source and/or binaries for
each of several different platforms for each program
and tool.  Maintaining all these files, and keeping them
consistent, has gotten to be a big hassle.

    Hence, to unify all these separate lists of asf software
into one, computer-readable master list, I've unified all
these separate lists into one computer-readable master list.
It's called "master_program_list", and it's in this directory.
There's also a program called "makemake", which parses the
master_program_list, updates the autotar directory, and 
creates the top-level Makefile.

   To run this program, and update these files, just 
type makemake.  To add a program or tool, modify
master_program_list, and run makemake.  Do note that
makemake depends also on each individual program's
Makefile to find library dependencies.

   To recompile makemake, just type
 --> make

   To save on disk space, this program is tarred up with
our source code instead of using many different platform 
makefiles.  The 'config' script will automatically call
makemake and create the top-level Makefile.

   To find out more, check out master_program_list,
makemake.c, or makestart.
