1.0 Introduction

XID is an X Window System application which allows the user to display, interactively
manipulate and store image and image related information. XID was developed to work in
conjunction with the Land Analysis System (LAS), however, there are some limited capabilities
to display and manipulate non-LAS images.

XID is built on the X Window System and uses the Motif (version 1.1 or 1.2) widget set for
its "look and feel". The building blocks of XID are software oriented, making XID a very
portable application. Any UNIX system capable of running X11R4 or X11R5 is capable of running
XID.

The disadvantage of a portable, software oriented system is a performance degradation for
certain tasks. For example, specialized hardware devices for image display have certain
functionality (such as zooming) built into the hardware. This makes these operations very fast
and efficient. XID must perform these types of operations in software resulting in a slower
response.

Another potential disadvantage of using the X Window System for image display is the limited
number of colors available. The user must keep in mind that because a portion of the X Window
System color map must be reserved for background colors, foreground colors, border colors,
shadow colors, etc., not all the possible colors are available for displaying image data (see
below for an alternative). On systems with 8-bit displays, only 200 of the 256 colors are
available for displaying image data. On systems with 24-bit displays, approximately 7 of the 8
bits for each red, green and blue band are available for displaying image data. The major
effect on the user is that certain mapping operations, such as pseudocoloring, may not work as
expected. For example, when displaying a black and white image (with a minimum value of 0 and a
maximum value of 255), each individual gray level will NOT have its own color map cell. The
resulting side effect is that when the user assigns red to the pixel value 0, pixel value 1 may
also become red since it may share the same color map cell. An alternative to this is to select
User Preferences from the Setup pulldown menu. This function allows the user to choose either
200 or 256 image colors. By selecting 256 image colors, the user is dedicating a separate color
map to the main image window. This will give the user the full range of colors but will also
cause a great deal more swapping of color maps.

Following is a list and short description of general XID capabilities.

1. Image file interfaces. 
      Load LAS images. 
      Load nonLAS images. 
      Exit the XID application. 

2. General image analysis tools. 
      Display coordinate values for the current cursor position. 
      Generate a histogram of the displayed image. 
      Interactive power spectrum plot of the displayed image. 
      Interactive profile of the displayed image. 

3. Additional image views. 
      Display a full resolution window of the displayed image. 
      Save a LAS image to disk. 
      Display a zoomed window of the displayed image. 

4. General image display capabilities. 
      Flicker two or more images. 
      Initialize the image window. 
      Define various types of mappings (eg. pseudocolor, piecewise linear, interactive adjust)
      as well as save and retrieve mappings. 
      Show different band combinations of the currently loaded images/bands. 

5. Graphics capabilities. 
      Draw, display or edit graphics overlay files (GOFs). 
      Generate a graphics plane mask. 

6. General XID setup functions. 
      Memory layout. 
      User preferences. 

7. General information. 
      Current display configuration (type, width and height). 
      On-line help access. 
      Description of current mouse button functionality. 

1.1 User Notes

1. Functionality that was originally designed into XID but which has not yet been implemented
   is indicated by the particular option being insensitive. An insensitive item (button, radio
   button, etc.) is one which shows as a lighter color than the other items (i.e., grayed out).
   An option may also be made insensitive when it is not appropriate to select that option at a
   given time. It will be made sensitive when it becomes appropriate. 

2. As a general rule, using the dismiss button to close an XID panel indicates the operation
   or function will be completed or saved. Selecting the cancel button indicates the operation
   will be ignored (as if it had never been done). 

3. Also as a general rule, the user should always press enter after typing data into a text
   field. This signals the XID process that entry has been completed. There are cases in which
   pressing enter is optional. These exceptions are noted in the documentation. 

4. There are several resources an XID user may wish to set. Listed below are the more commonly
   used ones. 

      xid*shell_mainmenu.geometry can be used to set the initial location of the main
      menu. For example:

      xid*shell_mainmenu.geometry: +0+0

      will place the main menu in the upper left corner of the display screen. 

      xid*shell_mainwin.geometry can be used to set the initial location of the main image
      window. For example:

      xid*shell_mainwin.geometry: +0+90

      will place the main image window just below the main menu in the upper left corner of the
      display screen. 

      xid*XmForm.load_fileselector.dirMask can be used to indicate the location of the
      user's images. For example: 

      xid*XmForm.load_fileselector.dirMask: ~huewe\/images\/*.img

      will set the default filter on the file selection box for the load functions to the
      specified directory. Note that the directory separator ("/") must be escaped using a
      backslash ("\"). 

      xid*colors_message can be used to turn on or off the warning message concerning the
      number of colors required by the loaded image. For example: 

      xid*colors_message: False

      indicates the user does not wish to see the warning message. 

      xid*background and xid*foreground can be used to set the background and foreground
      colors for the XID panels. The user may also wish to set the top and bottom shadow colors
      using the resources xid*topShadowColor and xid*bottomShadowColor to coordinate
      with the background color specified. 

5. There are also several command line options the user may specify to indicate initial
   placement of the main menu and main image window. 

      Starting XID using the command xid -ul indicates the main menu is to be placed in the
      upper left corner of the display with the main image window directly below it. 

      Starting XID using the command xid -ur indicates the main menu is to be placed in the
      upper right corner of the display with the main image window directly below it. 

      Starting XID using the command xid -ll indicates the main image window is to be placed in
      the lower left corner of the display with the main menu directly above it. 

      Starting XID using the command xid -lr indicates the main image window is to be placed in
      the lower right corner of the display with the main menu directly above it.
