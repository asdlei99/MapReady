<A name="LAS"><H2>2.1 Load LAS Images</H2></A>

The load LAS images function
allows the user to select a LAS image to be loaded into the currently defined
<B>memory planes</B>.  A list of images in the current directory is displayed
by default (using the standard Motif file selector).  The user has several 
options at this point:<P>

<OL>
<LI>The user may select one of the images listed below the label <B>Files:</B>
by clicking the left mouse button on the choice, and 
then clicking the <B>OK</B> button, or by simply double 
clicking the left mouse button on the choice.<P>

<LI>The user may select an image from another directory
by typing the directory specification into the box below 
the label <B>File Filter:</B> and pressing <B>enter</B> (or clicking 
on the <B>Filter</B> button).  This displays a list of files 
from the directory specified.  Directory navigation can also be done
by clicking the left mouse button on a directory name in the the list
below the <B>Directories:</B> label and then clicking on the <B>Filter</B>
button (or by just double clicking on the directory name).<P>

<LI>The user may also select an image (by clicking the left
mouse button on the choice) and then enter a window and/or 
band specification.  The image name selected appears in 
the text box below the label <B>Selection:</B>.  The window 
and/or band specification may then be entered by clicking
the left mouse button in the text box and entering the 
specification using standard LAS syntax 
(i.e., image_name(sl,ss,nl,ns:b1,b2,b3)).  Finally, the 
user may type a LAS image name directly in the text box 
below the label <B>Selection:</B>.
</OL>

Each band of the selected image is loaded into a separate
memory plane and is subsampled, if necessary, to fit into the 
defined size of the memory plane.  The <A href=layout.html>layout</A>
function may be 
used to redefine the memory plane configuration and/or the viewport
configuration.  A scale and 
offset are also calculated and applied to the image data if the 
input data is not <I>BYTE</I> data.<P>

XID has been designed to work with both 24-bit and 8-bit
color displays.  In order to display a 3-band color image 
on an 8-bit color display (PseudoColor visual), the 24 bits 
of image data must be compressed to 8 bits.  The color 
compression algorithm used is a median cut color compression 
algorithm taken from code developed for NASA JPL by the 
California Institute of Technology in 1989.  This algorithm 
produces an image with the specified number of colors along 
with a color map used to display the image.  XID actually 
reduces the image to 200 colors (rather than 256) in order to 
reserve 56 colors for other operations.  Single band black and 
white images are also reduced to 200 gray level values.<P>

Display of images on 24-bit displays (DirectColor visual)
requires less compression of the image data but still
requires some compresssion in order to reserve a number of 
colors for other operations.  Each band of a color image is 
essentially reduced to 7 bits resulting in a 21-bit (rather 
than 24-bit) image.  As described for pseudocolor displays, 
a single band black and white image is reduced to 200 gray 
level values for output to a 24-bit display.<P>

<A name="NONLAS"><H2>2.2 Load nonLAS Images</H2></A>

The load nonLAS images function
allows the user to select any flat file containing image data to be loaded 
into the currently defined
<B>memory planes</B>.  A list of files with the extension .img in the current 
directory are displayed
by default (using the standard Motif file selector).  The user has several 
options at this point:<P>

<OL>
<LI>The user may select one of the images listed below the label <B>Files:</B>
by clicking the left mouse button on the choice, and 
then clicking the <B>OK</B> button, or by simply double 
clicking the left mouse button on the choice.<P>

<LI>The user may select an image from another directory
by typing the directory specification into the box below 
the label <B>File Filter:</B> and pressing <B>enter</B> (or clicking 
on the <B>Filter</B> button).  This displays a list of files 
from the directory specified.  Directory navigation can also be done
by clicking the left mouse button on a directory name in the the list
below the <B>Directories:</B> label and then clicking on the <B>Filter</B>
button (or by just double clicking on the directory name).<P>

<LI>The user may also select an image (by clicking the left
mouse button on the choice) and then enter a window and/or 
band specification.  The image name selected appears in 
the text box below the label <B>Selection:</B>.  The window 
and/or band specification may then be entered by clicking
the left mouse button in the text box and entering the 
specification using standard LAS syntax 
(i.e., image_name(sl,ss,nl,ns:b1,b2,b3)).  Finally, the 
user may type an image name directly in the text box 
below the label <B>Selection:</B>.

For nonLAS images, the user is required to enter information describing the
input image such as number of lines, number of samples, etc. (see below).
After the appropriate information has been entered, each band of the selected 
image is loaded into a separate
memory plane and is subsampled, if necessary, to fit into the 
defined size of the memory plane.  The <A href=layout.html>layout</A>
function may be 
used to redefine the memory plane configuration and/or the viewport
configuration.  A scale and 
offset are also calculated and applied to the image data if the 
input data is not <I>BYTE</I> data.<P>

XID has been designed to work with both 24-bit and 8-bit
color displays.  In order to display a 3-band color image 
on an 8-bit color display (PseudoColor visual), the 24 bits 
of image data must be compressed to 8 bits.  The color 
compression algorithm used is a median cut color compression 
algorithm taken from code developed for NASA JPL by the

produces an image with the specified number of colors along 
with a color map used to display the image.  XID actually 
reduces the image to 200 colors (rather than 256) in order to 
reserve 56 colors for other operations.  Single band black and 
white images are also reduced to 200 gray level values.<P>

Display of images on 24-bit displays (DirectColor visual)
requires less compression of the image data but still
requires some compresssion in order to reserve a number of 
colors for other operations.  Each band of a color image is 
essentially reduced to 7 bits resulting in a 21-bit (rather 
than 24-bit) image.  As described for pseudocolor displays, 
a single band black and white image is reduced to 200 gray 
level values for output to a 24-bit display.<P>
