<H1>X Image Display (XID)</H1>

<H2>1.0 Introduction</H2>

XID is an X Window System application which allows
the user to display, interactively manipulate and  store image and image
related information.
XID was developed to work in conjunction with the Land Analysis
System (LAS), however, there are some limited capabilities to display and
manipulate non-LAS images.<P> 

XID is built on the <B>X Window System</B> and uses the <B>Motif</B>
(version 1.1 or 1.2) widget set for 
its "look and feel".  The building blocks of XID are software
oriented, making XID a very portable application.  Any UNIX system capable
of running X11R4 or X11R5 is capable of running XID.<P>

The disadvantage of
a portable, software oriented system is a performance degradation for certain
tasks.  For example, specialized hardware devices for image display have
certain functionality (such as zooming) built into the hardware.  This makes 
these operations 
very fast and efficient.  XID must perform these types of operations in 
software resulting in a slower response.<P>

Another potential disadvantage of using the X Window System for image display
is the limtied number of colors available.
The user must keep in mind that because a portion
of the X Window System color map must be reserved for background colors, 
foreground colors, border colors, shadow colors, etc., not all the possible 
colors are available for displaying image data (see below for an alternative).
On systems with 8-bit
displays, only 200 of the 256 colors are available for displaying image data.
On systems with 24-bit displays, approximately 7 of the 8 bits for each
red, green and blue band are available for displaying image data.  The major
effect on the user is that certain mapping operations, such as pseudocoloring,
may not work as expected.  For example, when displaying a black and
white image (with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 255), each
individual gray level will <B>NOT</B> have its own color map cell.  The
resulting side effect is that when the user assigns red to the pixel value
0, pixel value 1 may also become red since it may share the same color map
cell.  An alternative to this is to select <A href=pref.html>User 
Preferences</A> from the
<B>Setup</B> pulldown menu.  This function allows the user to choose either 
200 or 256 image colors.  By selecting 256 image colors, the user is 
dedicating a separate color map to the main image window.  This will give
the user the full range of colors but will also cause a great deal
more swapping of color maps.<P>

<H2>1.1 User Notes</H2>

<OL>
<LI>Functionality that was originally designed into XID but which has not
    yet been implemented is indicated by the particular option being
    <I>insensitive</I>.  An insensitive item (button, radio button, etc.)
    is one which shows as a lighter color than the other items (i.e., grayed
    out).
    An option may also be made insensitive when it is not appropriate to 
    select that option at a given time.  It will be made sensitive when it
    becomes appropriate.
    <P>

<LI>As a general rule, using the <B>dismiss</B> button to close an XID panel
    indicates the
    operation or function will be completed or saved.  Selecting the 
    <B>cancel</B> button
    indicates the operation will be ignored (as if it had never been done).
    <P>

<LI>Also as a general rule, the user should <B>always</B> press enter after
    typing data into a text field.  This signals the XID process that entry 
    has been completed.  There are cases in which pressing enter is optional. 
    These exceptions are noted in the documentation.
    <P>

<LI>There are several resources an XID user may wish to set.  Listed below are
    the more commonly used ones.
    <P>
    <UL>
    <LI><B>xid*shell_mainmenu.geometry</B> can be used to set the initial
	location of the main menu.  For example:<P>
	<PRE>xid*shell_mainmenu.geometry: +0+0</PRE> 
	will place the main menu in the upper left corner of the display screen.
    <P>

    <LI><B>xid*shell_mainwin.geometry</B> can be used to set the initial
	location of the main image window.  For example:<P>
	<PRE>xid*shell_mainwin.geometry: +0+90</PRE> 
	will place the main image window just below the main menu in the upper 
	left corner of the display screen.
    <P>

    <LI><B>xid*XmForm.load_fileselector.dirMask</B> can be used to indicate
	the location of the user's images.  For example:
	<PRE>xid*XmForm.load_fileselector.dirMask: ~huewe\/images\/*.img</PRE>
	will set the default filter on the file selection box for the load 
	functions to the specified directory.  Note that the directory
	separator ("/") must be escaped using a backslash ("\").
    <P>

    <LI><B>xid*colors_message</B> can be used to turn on or off the warning 
	message
	concerning the number of colors required by the loaded image.  For
	example:
	<PRE>xid*colors_message: False</PRE>
	indicates the user does not wish to see the warning message.
    <P>

    <LI><B>xid*background</B> and <B>xid*foreground</B> can be used to set
	the background and foreground colors for the XID panels.  The user
	may also wish to set the top and bottom shadow colors using the
	resources <B>xid*topShadowColor</B> and <B>xid*bottomShadowColor</B>
	to coordinate with the background color specified.
    </UL>
    <P>

<LI>There are also several command line options the user may specify to
    indicate initial placement of the main menu and main image window.
    <P>

    <UL>
    <LI>Starting XID using the command <B>xid -ul</B> indicates the main menu 
	is to be placed in the
	upper left corner of the display with the main image window
	directly below it.
    <P>

    <LI>Starting XID using the command <B>xid -ur</B> indicates the main menu
	is to be placed in the
	upper right corner of the display with the main image window
	directly below it.
    <P>

    <LI>Starting XID using the command <B>xid -ll</B> indicates the main image
	window is to be placed 
	in the lower left corner of the display with the main menu directly 
	above it.
    <P>

    <LI>Starting XID using the command <B>xid -lr</B> indicates the main image
	window is to be placed 
	in the lower right corner of the display with the main menu directly 
	above it.
