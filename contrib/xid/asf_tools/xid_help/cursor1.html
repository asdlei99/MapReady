<H2>3.1 Cursor</H2>

The cursor function displays line/sample values in both image
and file coordinates and displays a matrix of gray level values
surrounding the point of interest.  Optionally, the user may
choose to display:<P>

<OL>
<LI>Projection coordinates

<LI>Latitude/longitude coordinates

<LI>Unscaled gray level values
</OL>

This information may be calculated for any displayed image
window (e.g., main image window, full resolution image window, 
zoom image window, etc.) by using the mouse to move the cursor 
into the appropriate window.  Single-stepping the cursor is 
also provided for precise movement through a keyboard interface.
The <B>"h"</B>, <B>"j"</B>, <B>"k"</B>, and <B>"l"</B> keys are used to 
move the cursor 
left, down, up, and right one pixel respectively, in addition
to the four arrow keys.  Using the <B>shift key</B> in combination with 
the special or arrow keys, moves the cursor in the corresponding 
direction ten pixels.

<DT><B>Gray Level Matrix:</B>
<DD>A 3X3 matrix of gray level values
(or pixel intensity values).  The center value is the gray 
level value of the current cursor position and the remaining
matrix values represent those values immediately surrounding 
the center pixel.
<P>

<DT><B>Line/Sample:</B>
<DD>A text field which displays a one-relative coordinate
calculated from the upper left corner of the displayed
image.  Therefore, the upper left coordinate will always be 
1,1 and the lower right coordinate will be the size of the 
displayed image.
<P>

<DT><B>File Coordinate:</B>
<DD>A text field which displays a one-relative line and 
sample coordinate calculated from the upper left corner 
of the orignal disk image.  This coordinate may differ from the
line/sample coordinate described above by the window loaded, 
the subsampling and/or the zoom factor applied.
<P>

<DT><B>Projection Coord:</B>
<DD>A toggle button which when selected displays a coordinate respresenting
the X/Y position of the cursor in the coordinate 
space defined by the map projection of the image.  The corner 
coordinates, as well as the units these coordinates are specified
in (e.g., meters), must be stored with the image for this 
option to function.  An error message will be output to the 
user if the appropriate information is not available.  <B>Note:</B>
for LAS 5.0 images, this information is stored in the DDR of 
the image.
<P>

<DT><B>Lat/Long:</B>
<DD>A toggle button which when selected displays a coordinate representing
the latitude/longitude position of the cursor.  XID uses the 
geometric transformation package GCTP to perform this calcula-
tion.  Therefore, the corner coordinates (in projection coordi-
nates) of the image, as well as 15 projection parameters defining 
the projection, must be stored with the image for this option to 
function.  An error message will be output to the user if the 
appropriate information is not available.  <B>Note:</B> for LAS 5.0 
images, this information is stored in the DDR of the image.
<P>

<DT><B>Unscaled:</B>
<DD>A toggle button which when selected displays values representing
an approximation of the original red, green, and blue gray level values 
of the current point.  This option applies only if the original 
image data was two-byte integer, four-byte integer, or floating
point data which requires the image data to be scaled at load
time.  These values are only approximations since the original
values are not read from disk, but are calculated based on the 
scale and offset applied to the data when the image was loaded.

The <B>original</B> and <B>mapped</B> radio buttons allow the user to 
select how gray level values are displayed.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>
    <DT><B>Original:</B>
    <DD>The gray level values are to be displayed as the original values as 
	they are loaded into the image planes (i.e., for non-byte data, the 
	unscaled values are not displayed).
    <P>

    <DT><B>Mapped</B>:
    <DD>The gray level values are to be displayed as gray level values with 
	the current mapping applied (i.e., mapped gray level values indicate 
        how the value looks to the user, rather than the actual value).
</DL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The <B>X/Y</B> and <B>Z</B> radio buttons allow the user to select the
dimension to cursor in.  
	
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>
    <DT><B>X/Y:</B>
    <DD>Gray level values are reported for the currently displayed image.
	If a color image is displayed, red, green, and 
	blue gray level values are displayed.  If a single 
	band black and white image is displayed, only the
	gray level values for that band are displayed.
    <P>

    <DT><B>Z:</B>
    <DD>Gray level values are reported for a single band at a time.  
	The <A href=#MANUAL>manual option</A> is automatically enabled 
	when the Z 
	dimension is selected.  The user chooses which band the values 
	are displayed for, with the slider in the lower right 
	corner of the panel.  As the user moves the slider, 
	values are updated for the current band.  The current
	band is indicated by the slider.

The <B>automatic</B> and <B>manual</B> radio buttons allow the user to
select the update mode for the cursor information panel.<P>  
	
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>
    <DT><B>Automatic:</B>
    <DD>In <B>automatic</B> mode, the cursor panel information is updated 
	each time the user moves the mouse within an image window.
    <P>
    
    <A name=MANUAL><DT><B>Manual:</B></A>
    <DD>In <B>manual</B> mode, the cursor panel information is updated only 
	when the user clicks the left mouse button in an image window.

<DT><B>Dismiss:</B>
<DD>Close the cursor panel.
