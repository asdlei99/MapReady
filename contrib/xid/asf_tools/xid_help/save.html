<TITLE>4.3 Save LAS Image</TITLE>
<H2>4.2 Save LAS Image</H2>

The save function allows the user to save various XID windows to disk as
LAS format images.  Any mappings currently applied to the image will be
applied to the image data before the image is written to disk and any
graphics data currently displayed is written into the image (i.e., engraved 
into the image).

<DL>
<DT><B>LAS Image Name:</B>
<DD>Enter the name of the image to be created.  This name may be entered
    as a LAS name or a host name.  No case conversions are done but keep
    in mind that LAS does not handle names with upper case letters properly.
    The user is not required to press <B>enter</B> after entering the image
    name since the name is not retrieved until the user presses the <B>apply
    </B> button.
</DL>

The <B>save all</B>, and <B>save viewed</B> radio buttons allow the user to 
select what part of the image window will be saved.

    <DT><B>Save All:</B>
    <DD>When selected, the entire image loaded into memory is saved to disk,
	including any image data not currently visible.  With this option,
	only image and graphics data are saved (i.e., no window frames,
	scrollbars, etc. are saved).  The number of output bands created
	for this option depends on the type of image displayed.  If a black
	and white image is displayed, all color channels are mapped the
	same, and no graphics data is displayed, a single band image is 
	created, otherwise a 3-band image is created.
    <P>

    <DT><B>Save Viewed:</B>
    <DD>When selected, only the visible portion of the image is saved to 
	disk.  The user is allowed to select the window to be saved
	using the mouse much like the X application <I>xwd</I>.  Technically,
	this does not have to be an XID image window.  It can be any window 
	currently visible on the display screen (eg., the root window,
	a window from another application, the XID histogram window, etc.). 
	A 3-band image is always saved to disk using this option.

<DT><B>Save Window:</B>
<DD>Select the XID image window to be saved.  The user may choose from the
    main image window, the full resolution image window or the zoom image
    window.  This option is available only when the <B>save all</B> option
    has been selected.

<DD>Choose whether or not to save the window manager frame with the image.
    If <B>without frame</B> is chosen and the window to be saved is an XID
    image window (main image, full resolution or zoom window), the scroll bars
    are not saved.  This option is available only when the <B>save 
    viewed</B> option has been selected.

   window manager.
