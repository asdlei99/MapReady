<H2>7.2 User Preferences</H2>

The preferences function allows the user to choose a cursor color (the
default is green) and the number of image colors to use when displaying
image data.<P>

<DL>
<DT><B>Cursor Color:</B>
<DD>Choose one of the eight specified cursor colors.  The change takes
    affect as soon as the color is selected (i.e., before the user closes
    the <B>preferences</B> panel).  The default cursor color is green.
</DL>

The <B>200</B> and <B>256</B> radio buttons allow the user to select the 
number of colors to use when displaying image data.  On 8-bit displays 
this refers to the total number of image colors, on 24-bit displays this
refers to the number of colors per color channel (red, green and blue).

    <DT><B>200:</B>
    <DD>When selected, 200 image colors will be used on 8-bit displays and
	200 image colors per channel will be used on 24-bit displays.  This
	results in some color compression on all displays including 24-bit 
	displays.  As a result, each gray level in the image does 
	not have it's own unique color map cell and mapping operations may
	not work as expected in all cases.  For example, it may not be possible
	to color pixels with gray levels 0 and 1 different colors or map values
	0 and 1 to different break points.  200 image colors is the default.
    <P>

    <DT><B>256:</B>
    <DD>When selected, 256 image colors will be used on 8-bit displays and
	256 image colors per channel will be used on 24-bit displays.  With 
 	256 colors there is no color compression done on the image data.
	The disadvantage to this method is that the image requires a 
	separate color map from the other XID panels resulting in an increased 
	color map "flashing" problem.
