<H2>5.3.2 Load Mapping</H2>

The load mapping function allows the user to retrieve a mapping
from a display and LUT file (DLTF) and apply it to the displayed
image.  An attempt is made to locate the specified DLTF entry 
in the DLTF associated with the first band of the displayed 
image.  An attempt is also made to match the band numbers of the 
displayed image with the band numbers stored in the DLTF entry.
If a match cannot be made, the first 3 LUTs of the DLTF entry
are used.  If the DLTF does not exist, if the user does not have
permission to read from the file, or the DLTF entry does not
exist in the associated file, a popup panel with an error
message is displayed and the user is required to enter a DLTF name.
