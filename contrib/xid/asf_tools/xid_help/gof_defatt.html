<H2>6.2 Define Attributes</H2>

This function allows the user to define attribute names for the current GOF.  
Attributes can be used to help
further define or describe graphics elements.  For example, a polygon GOF
may have the attributes <I>class</I> and <I>site</I> defined.  For each
polygon selected by the user, these attributes may optionally be given
corresponding values.  A maximum of 35 attributes may be defined for each 
type of GOF.<P> 

Attributes may be defined before, during, or after a graphics element has
been selected.  Attributes may also be defined while editting a graphics
element.

The <B>ascii</B>, <B>integer</B>, and <B>real</B> radio buttons allow the user 
to select a data type for the value of the attribute.  This data type is
used for some basic type checking when the attribute is given a value.
