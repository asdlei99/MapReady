<H2>5.4 Show Loaded Images</H2>

The show function allows the user to select which plane numbers or saved
image combinations 
are to be displayed in the red, green and blue channels or to 
select which plane number is to be displayed as a black and 
white image.  To view a color composite image, the user need only use the
mouse to select a single plane number from each plane list (i.e., one for 
the red, one for the green and one for the blue channel) and press the
<B>accept</B> button.  If only 2 image planes are selected, the third will
be a duplicate of one of the selected planes.  To view a black and white
(i.e., gray scale image), select only one plane number from any plane list
or select the same plane number in all three lists and press the <B>accept</B>
button.
The image data loaded into the selected plane will be displayed in black
and white.

The <B>Show</B> function also allows the user to obtain information about the
image data loaded into a particular image plane.  By double clicking the
left mouse button on a plane number (from the red, green or blue plane list), 
an image information panel is popped
up which shows the file name the image data was read from, the window that
was loaded, the band number and the subsampling factor.  By double clicking on
a name in the save list, the user can determine which planes were used in the
saved combination.

<DD>The list of currently saved band combinations and mappings.  To view a
    previously saved combination, select the name and press the <B>accept</B>
    button.  The entry <B>Current</B> is a special entry.  Double clicking

<DT><B>Delete:</B>
<DD>Delete the selected item from the save list.  The <B>delete</B> button
    is sensitive only when an item has been selected from the save list.
    Image data is not deleted; only the reference to the band combination
    and mapping is deleted.

<DT><B>Accept:</B>
<DD>Display the selected planes in the appropriate channels.  On 8-bit 
    displays, displaying a color image with the show function implies the
