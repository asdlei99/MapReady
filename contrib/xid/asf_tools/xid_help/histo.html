<H2>3.2 Histogram</H2>

The histogram function generates a distributional histogram
(by default) for the currently displayed image data.  For
a multi-band image, a separate histogram graph is generated 
for each displayed image band (i.e. one for red, one for 
green, and one for blue).  For a single-band image, only 
one histogram graph is displayed.  Along with the graphs, 
the mean pixel value, standard deviation, minimum pixel 
value and maximum pixel value for each band are also calculated.  
The user may also obtain histogram percentage information by moving 
the cursor over the histogram graph.

<DT><B>Percentage Information:</B>
<DD>This information is generated when the user moves the cursor
over the histogram graph within the bounds of the X axis of
the graph (the Y position of the cursor is not relevant).
The cursor position, along the X axis, indicates a specific
gray level value.  The percentage value represents the 
percentage of pixels with a gray level value less than or 
equal to the selected gray level.

    <DT><B>Image:</B>
    <DD>A histogram is calculated for the currently displayed image (default).
    <P>

    <DT><B>Line:</B>
    <DD>A histogram is calculated for all pixels that lie along a line.
    <P>

    <DT><B>Poly:</B>
    <DD>A histogram is calculated for all pixels that are contained within 
        a defined polygon.

    <DT><B>X/Y:</B>
    <DD>A histogram is calculated for all bands of the currently displayed 
        image.
    <P>

    <DT><B>X/Z:</B>
    <DD>A histogram is calculated for the line of 
	the image indicated by the cursor 
	position for all bands currently loaded (whether
	they are displayed or not).  For example, if the 
	cursor is positioned at line 100 and there are 
	currently 10 image planes which contain image data,
	the histogram displayed shows the values for line 
	100 of all 10 planes.
    <P>

    <DT><B>Y/Z:</B>
    <DD>A histogram is calculated 
	for the column of the image indicated by the cursor 
	position for all bands currently loaded (whether
	they are displayed or not).  For example, if the 
	cursor is positioned at sample 50 and there are 
	currently 25 image planes which contain image data,
	the histogram displayed shows the values for sample 
	100 of all lines in the image (i.e., a column of data)
	of all 10 planes.

<DL>
    <DT><B>Distributional:</B>
    <DD>The x-axis of the histogram represents gray level 
	values 0 to 255; the y-axis represents the 
	total number of pixels that have the 
	corresponding gray level value.
    <P>

    <DT><B>Cumulative:</B>
    <DD>The x-axis of the histogram represents gray level 
	values 0 to 255; the y-axis represents the total number
	of pixels that have the corresponding gray 
	level as well as all previous gray levels.

The <B>original</B> and <B>mapped</B> radio buttons allow the user

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>
    <DT><B>Original:</B>
    <DD>Calculate a histogram for the image values as they are loaded into 
	the image planes (i.e., for non-byte data, the 
	unscaled values are not used).  
    <P>

    <DT><B>Mapped:</B>
    <DD>Calculate a histogram for the mapped image values as 
	they appear on the 
	display monitor (i.e., the current mapping is 
	applied before the histogram is calculated).

<DL>
<DT><B>Mask Values:</B>
<DD>Enter specific pixel values and/or ranges of values to be 
    excluded from the histogram calculations.  Specific
    pixel values are separated by commas, while range values
    are separated by a dash.  The following conditions
    cause an error message to be displayed:
    <P>

    <OL>
    <LI>The first character in the mask value specification is not numeric.

    <LI>Any alphabetic characters appear in the specification.

    <LI>Any punctuation marks other than a dash (-) or a comma (,) are used.

    <LI>Two consecutive punctuation marks appear in the specification.

    <LI>Both ends of a range are not specified (i.e. "10 - " or "- 100").

    <LI>A value less than 0 or greater than 255 is specified.
