<H2>6.2 Graphics Plane Mask</H2>

The mask function allows the user to create a graphics mask
of specified intensity values for the single band displayed
image.  The user is allowed to create up to four individual
masks.  Each mask may have its own unique color which is
selected from the eight predefined colors in the <B>mask color box</B>.

<DL>
<DT><B>Mask Color:</B>
<DD>The color box shows the user the eight predefined colors
    available for the graphics masks.  The user selects a color by
    pressing the left mouse button on the desired color.  The 
    selected color will be outlined in gold to indicate that it
    has been selected.
<P>

<DT><B>Values:</B>
<DD>This text field allows the user to enter the range of image values 
    and/or the specific image values for which the mask is to be created.  
    Range values should be separated by a dash (-) and individual image 
    values should be separated by either a space or a comma (,).  The 
    following conditions cause an error message to be displayed:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The first character in the input specification is not numeric.
<LI>Any alphabetic characters appear in the specification.
<LI>Any punctuation marks other than a dash (-) or a comma (,) are used.
<LI>Two consecutive punctuation marks appear in the specification.
<LI>Both ends of a range are not specified (i.e. "10 - " or "- 100").
<LI>A value less than 0 or greater than 255 is specified.
</OL>
<P>

<DT><B>Rotator Icon:</B>
<DD>The rotator icon allows the user to select the current graphics
    mask to be generated or cleared.  Clicking the left mouse button 
    on the icon increments the current graphics mask number by one.
    The graphics mask number continues to be incremented until the 
    maximum graphics mask number is reached (four), at which point 
    the current graphics mask number returns to one.
<P>

<DT><B>Apply:</B>
<DD>Generate and display the graphics mask based on the image values 
    specified by the user.  Validation of the range and bin specification is
    done at this time.  If an error is detected in the specification, the 
    mask is not generated. 
<P>

<DT><B>Clear:</B>
<DD>Erase the current graphics mask.  Since clearing the graphics mask 
    involves regenerating the image, there will be a delay before the image
    is redisplayed after the <B>clear</B> button is selected.
<P>

<DT><B>Dismiss:</B>
<DD>Close the graphics mask panel.
</DL>
<P>
<B>Note:</B> Initializing the graphics planes from the <B>Initialize</B> panel
does not clear graphics masks.  Use the <B>clear</B> button on the <B>
graphics plane mask</B> panel to erase any graphics masks no longer needed.
