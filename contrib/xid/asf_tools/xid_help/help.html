XID uses the NCSA Mosaic application for viewing its on-line help.
NCSA Mosaic is a networked information discovery, retrieval, and collaboration
tool and World
Wide Web browser developed at the National Center for Supercomputing 
Applications. <P>

Mosaic provides a hypertext interface to the global Internet. Hypertext is 
text which contains highlighted links, called hyperlinks or anchors, to other 
texts. Each highlighted phrase (in color or underlined) is a hyperlink to 
another document or information resource. Single
click with the left mouse button on any highlighted phrase to follow the link.
To follow a link, in this
sense, means that Mosaic will retrieve the document associated with the 
selected hyperlink and display it.<P>
