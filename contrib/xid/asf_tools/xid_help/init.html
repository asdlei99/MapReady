<H2>5.2 Initialize</H2>

The initialize function allows the user to clear specified
memory and graphics planes and/or initialize the display
mapping to a linear mapping.  If the user selects the <B>main 
window</B>, or the <B>plane</B> radio button in conjunction with the 
<B>all planes</B> toggle button, the user is prompted for verification 
of the action.  Selecting <B>OK</B> from the verification box continues with 
the initialization process; selecting <B>Cancel</B> closes the initialization 
panel without taking any further action.

The <B>main window</B>, <B>plane</B>, and <B>mapping</B> radio buttons 
allow the user to select the type of initialization to be done.

<DL>
    <DT><B>Main Window:</B>
    <DD>Initialize the entire display.  All image and graphics
	planes are cleared and the mapping is initialized to a 
	linear mapping.
    <P>

    <DT><B>Plane:</B>
    <DD>Allow the user to choose which image planes are to be 
	cleared.  A single image plane or all image planes may be cleared.  
	To change the current image plane, the user must click the left 
	mouse button on the rotator icon.  To clear all image 
	planes, the toggle button labeled <B>All Planes</B> 
	must be selected.
    <P>

    <DT><B>Mapping:</B>
    <DD>Initialize the mapping of the display.  Initializing the mapping
	consists of loading a linear or identity mapping.

<DT><B>Rotator Icon:</B>
<DD>Select the image plane to be cleared.  Clicking the left mouse button on 
    the icon increments the current plane number by one.  The plane number 
    continues to be incremented until the maximum plane number is reached, at
    which point the current plane number becomes the letter "G" indicating
    the graphics planes are to be cleared.  By clicking the left button on the
    rotator again, the plane number returns to 1.  The maximum
    plane number is determined by the currently defined memory
    configuration (see the <A href=layout.html>Layout</A> function).
<P>

<DT><B>Current Plane Number:</B>
<DD>The current plane number text box shows the user the currently
    selected plane number.  This may be modified by using the 
    <B>rotator icon</B> (see description above).  The current plane 
    number is meaningful only when the <B>plane</B> radio button has 
    been selected.
<P>

<DT><B>All Planes:</B>
<DD>When selected, all currently defined image planes will be cleared.  If 
     this toggle button is not set, only the image plane indicated by the 
     text box next to the rotator icon is cleared.  This toggle button is
     displayed only when the <B>plane</B> radio button has been selected.
<P>

<DT><B>Apply:</B>
<DD>Close the intialize panel and perform the specified initialization task.
<P>

<DT><B>Cancel:</B>
<DD>Close the initialize panel without taking any action.
