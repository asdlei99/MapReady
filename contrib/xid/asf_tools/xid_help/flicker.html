<H2>5.1 Flicker Loaded Images</H2>

The flicker function allows a user to view, in sequence, a specified list
of images.  The user must first build a list of images to flicker.  This is
done much like images are selected for viewing in the <B>Show</B> function.
The user may select combinations of plane numbers or previously saved image 
combinations for flickering.  To select a combination of planes for flickering,
the user need only use the
mouse to select a single plane number from each plane list (i.e., one for 
the red, one for the green and one for the blue channel) and press the
<B>accept</B> button.  If only 2 image planes are selected, the third will
be a duplicate of one of the selected planes.  There will be a slight delay
while the flicker image is being created and once it is, the selected 
combination will be dislayed in the <B>Flicker List</B>.  To flicker a black 
and white (i.e., gray scale image), select only one plane number from any 
plane list or select the same plane number in all three lists and press the 
<B>accept</B> button.  To add a previously saved combination to the flicker
list, select the name and press the <B>accept</B> button.  
<P>

To flicker images with mappings applied, the user must first save the band
combinations and the associated mapping using the <B>save</B> option in
the <A href=show.html#save>Show</A> function.  The saved band combination
names will then appear in the save list and they can be selected for
flickering.

<DL>
<DT><B>Red, Green, and Blue Plane Lists:</B>
<DD>The plane lists show the user a list of plane numbers that 
    contain valid image data.  The user chooses the combinations of
    plane numbers to flicker from these lists.
<P>

<DT><B>Save List:</B>
<DD>The list of currently saved band combinations and mappings.  To select
    a previously saved combination for flickering, select the name and press 
    the <B>accept</B> button.
<P>

<DT><B>Flicker List:</B>
<DD>The list of currently selected plane number combinations and saved image
     combinations to flicker.
<P>

<DT><B>Delete:</B>
<DD>Delete the selected item from the flicker list.  The <B>delete</B> button
    is sensitive only when an item has been selected from the flicker list.
    Image data is not deleted; only the reference to the band combination
    and mapping is removed from the flicker list.
<P>

<DT><B>Accept:</B>
<DD>Accept the currently selected plane combination or saved image combination
    and build the flicker image.  On 8-bit displays, choosing a color image 
    for flickering implies the selected planes must be sent through the color 
    compression algorithm.
<P>

<DT><B>Step:</B>
<DD>Display the next image in the flicker list.  Image combinations will be
    flickered in the order they were added to the flicker list.  The <B>
    step</B> button is used to manually step through each image in the list.
<P>

<DT><B>Start:</B>
<DD>Begin the automatic flicker process.  Each image in the flicker list
    will be displayed in succession.  The number of seconds between the 
    display of each image is determined by the <B>rate slider</B>.
<P>

<DT><B>Rater Slider:</B>
<DD>The delay, in number of seconds, between the display of each image
    combination in the flicker list.  The delay may be from 0 seconds to
    10 seconds with a default of 1 second.  <B>Note:</B> it is not advisable
    to reduce the delay to 0 seconds.  This causes the flicker process to
    execute as fast as the host CPU will allow.  This makes it difficult
    for the application to process other events like button presses (for
    stopping the flicker process) because the process is spending all it's time
    displaying images.
<P>

<DT><B>Stop:</B>
<DD>Stop the automatic flicker process. The last image displayed will become
    the currently displayed image.
<P>

<DT><B>Clear:</B>
<DD>Clear all specifications from the flicker list.
<P>

<DT><B>Dismiss:</B>
<DD>Close the flicker panel.
