<H2>4.1 Full Resolution Image</H2>

The full resolution option allows the user to load (from
disk) full resolution windows of subsampled images.  The 
full resolution image is loaded into a separate display
window (i.e., it does not overwrite the main image window).
The <B>left mouse button</B> is used to select the center point
of an area of interest within the main image window.  A
full resolution window of the specified size is then read
from disk and displayed.  Edge conditions are handled by
moving the selected point of interest such that the 
specified size may be loaded.  If the full resolution
window size specified is larger than the loaded image,
the entire image will be loaded.  On both 8-bit and 24-bit
displays, the full resolution window will use the same
colormap as the main image window.
