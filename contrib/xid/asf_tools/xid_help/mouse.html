<H2>8.3 Mouse Context</H2>

The mouse context function presents the user with information about the 
function of each mouse button.  Various functions within XID make use of
the mouse buttons so their default meaning may change from one function to
the next.  Each set of definitions is called a <I>context</I>.  If more 
than three functions are required for a given context (assuming a 3-button
mouse), a pulldown menu at the button of the panel labelled <B>Additional</B>
is used accomodate the additional functions.<P>

The default context is the <I>Image</I> context.  In the image context the
left mouse button is used to select a full resolution window, the middle
mouse button is used to select an area to zoom around and the right mouse
button has no function.  The <B>additional</B> pulldown menu allows the
user to increase and decrease the zoom factor.  Various options from the
GOF functions add additional contexts.  The user may change contexts 
by selecting it from the option menu at the top of the panel.
One example when this may be necessary is when the user wishes to load a new
full resolution or zoom window while selecting or editting graphics data.
