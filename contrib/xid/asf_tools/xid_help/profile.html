<TITLE>3.4 Profile</TITLE>
<H2>3.4 Profile</H2>

The profile function activates an interactive profile session
for the displayed image in the main image window.  The X/Y profile 
plot represents
specific pixels and their corresponding gray level values.
See the description for the <B>X</B>, <B>Y</B>, and <B>Z</B> radio buttons 
for more details on the profile plot.  In addition to the 
x-axis and y-axis, a marker line is displayed in both the X 
and Y profiles.  This line represents the current sample in 
an X profile and the current line in a Y profile.  The profile 
also makes use of a viewport (just as the main image window) 
for any portion of the profile which falls outside the profile 
window.  This viewport is attached to the image viewport such 
that if the user moves the scrollbar in the main image window,
the scrollbar automatically moves in the profile window.<P>

the dimension the profile is to be calculated in.

<DL>
    <DT><B>X:</B>
    <DD>The x-axis of the profile plot 
        represents 1 to the number of displayed samples (a 
	single line of image data).  The y-axis represents 
	the corresponding gray level value of each pixel 
	(0 to 255).  
    <P>

    <DT><B>Y:</B>
    <DD>The x-axis of the profile plot 
	represents 1 to the number of displayed lines (a 
	single column of image data).  The y-axis represents 
	the corresponding gray level value of each pixel (0 
	to 255).
    <P>

    <DT><B>Z:</B>
    <DD>The x-axis of the profile plot 
	represents 1 to the number of image bands loaded.
	The y-axis again represents the corresponding gray 
	level value of each pixel.
</DL>
    In both the X and Y dimensions, the user will see three color coded
    profile lines on the plot representing the red, green and blue bands 
    if the displayed image is color.  If the displayed image is 
    black and white, there will be only one profile line.
