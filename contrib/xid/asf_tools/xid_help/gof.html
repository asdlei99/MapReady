<H2>6.1 GOF Graphics</H2>

The graphics overlay file (GOF) functions allow the user to 
draw graphics on the display and save graphics data
to GOFs, edit data in existing GOFs, and load graphics data from GOFs.  Refer 
to the LAS Programmer's Guide in the
section on Associated File Formats for more information on the format of
GOFs.<P>

Before the user can begin processing graphics data, the type of graphics data 
must be selected.  The user may also opt to modify
the default graphics overlay file name before the operation to be 
performed is selected.  The following types of graphics data are supported:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Points
<LI>Lines
<LI>Polygons (including rectangles)
<LI>Annotation (text)
</OL>
<P>

Next, the processing mode must be selected.  There are 3 processing modes
available:<P>

<OL>
<LI>Select
<LI>Load
<LI>Edit
</OL>
<P>
Described below are the instructions for processing in each of the 3 modes.

Selecting Graphics Data:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Once the type and mode have been selected, 
the user may enter a label to be associated with the graphics element.  This
label 
must be entered <B>before</B> the graphics element is selected.  If it is 
not, the user must use edit mode to add a label.  The color, line width, and
font may be specified before <B>or</B> after the graphics element is selected. 
Attributes may also be defined and/or 
set either before <B>or</B> after the graphics element is selected.
<P>

The following descriptions for 
selecting graphics data refer frequently to the <I>image</I>.  Keep in mind 
that the
<I>image</I> may be the main image, the full resolution image or the zoomed
image.  The user may switch between the different images at <B>any</B> 
time while in the process of selecting graphics data.<P>

For <B>point</B> data, the user need only select the desired point in the 
image using
the left mouse button.  An outline showing the extent of the label is then
displayed and the user may use the left mouse button to place the label.
The label can be changed (but not added), the color and font can be changed, 
and attributes can be added or changed until the user selects the next graphics 
type from the graphics type icons.  As soon as the next graphics type is 
selected, the
current point is written to the GOF.
<P>

For <B>line</B> or <B>polygon</B> data, the user must select each vertex 
of the line or polygon using the left
mouse button.  An outline or shadow of the line segment is displayed before 
it is selected to show the user where the line segment will be drawn.  
The middle mouse 
button can be used to erase the previous line segment and the right mouse 
button to end selection of the line.  An outline showing 
the extent of the label is then
displayed and the user may use the left mouse button to place the label.
The line or polygon label can be changed (but not added), the color, font,
and line width can be changed, 
and attributes can be added or changed until the user selects the next graphics
type
from the graphics type icons.  As soon as the next graphics type is selected, 
the current line
or polygon is written to the GOF.<P>

The <B>rectangle</B> is a special case of the polygon graphics data.  To select
a rectangle, use the left mouse button to select the upper
left corner of the rectangle.  An outline showing the width and height
of the rectangle is then drawn.  The user must now select the lower right
corner of the rectangle using the left mouse button and proceed as with
a line or polygon data.
<P>

For <B>annotation</B> data, the user must first enter an annotation text string.
Note that when the annotation text graphics type is selected, the <B>
label</B> field becomes a <B>text</B> field.  An outline showing the
extent of the text string is displayed and the user must use the left
mouse button to place the text on the image.  
The annotation text, color, and font can be changed,
and attributes can 
be added or changed until the user selects the next graphics type from the 
graphics type icons.  As soon as the next graphics type is selected, the 
current annotation element is
written to the GOF.<P>

Loading Graphics Data:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To load graphics data, the user must simply select the graphics type, modify
the GOF name if necessary, and select the load button.  The graphics data are
then read from the GOF and drawn over the displayed image.  If the GOF
was created in XID, the graphics elements will retain the same color, line
width and font as they were created with.  If the GOF was not created in
XID, the graphics elements will be displayed with the first color, line width,
and font from the corresponding option menus.  The graphics elements are drawn
over the main image window, the full resolution window and the zoom window.

<DT><B>Color:</B>
<DD>Select the color for the current graphics element.  The user may choose
    from one of eight predefined colors (black, white, red, green, blue,
    yellow, magenta, or cyan).  If the user wishes to select from a
    different set of colors, place a file named .xid_colors in the root
    directory of the login account containing the desired color names (one 
    name per line).  The default color is the first color listed on the option
    menu.  For a list of available colors, run the pseudocolor
    mapping function and choose the <B>color list</B> option (see 
    <A href=psd.html>section 5.2.3</A>).  If more
    than eight colors are specified in the file, the extra colors will be
    ignored.  If fewer than eight colors are specified, the remaining colors
    will be set to the original defaults.
<P>

<DT><B>Line Width:</B>
<DD>Select the line width for the current graphics element.  Line width
    is only applicable for line, rectangle, and polygon data.  Valid line widths
    are 1 through 5 pixels with a default of one.
<P>

<DT><B>Font:</B>
<DD>Select the font for the label of the point, line, rectangle, or polygon
    data or for the text of the annotation data.  The user may choose from
    one of nine predefined fonts.  If the user wishes to select from a 
    different set of fonts, place a file named .xid_fonts in the root
    directory of the login account containing the desired font names (one 
    name per line).  The default font is the first font listed on the option
    menu.  To
    determine the available fonts on a system, run the function <B>xlsfonts</B>.
    If more
    than nine fonts are specified in the file, the extra font names will be
    ignored.  If fewer than nine fonts are specified, the remaining fonts
    will be set to the original defaults.
<P>

<DT><B>Define Attributes:</B>
<DD>Define attribute names for the current graphics overlay file.  See
    <A href=gof_defatt.html>section 6.2</A> for more information on
