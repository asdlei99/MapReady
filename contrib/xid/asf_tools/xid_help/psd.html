<H2>5.3.4 Pseudocolor</H2>

The pseudocolor function allows the user to create and
apply a pseudocolor mapping to the displayed black and
white image.  Pseudocolor mappings are created by assigning
a color to a range of image values and/or to specific image values.

<DL>
    <DT><B>Color List:</B>
    <DD>Select a color name from the standard list of X11 color names.
    <P>

    <DT><B>Color Sliders:</B>
    <DD>Display red, green and blue color bars which allow the user to 
	mix these colors to create the desired color.  This is the default.
    <P>
</DL>
With either method of color selection, the current color is displayed in 
the box above the <B>apply</B> button.

<DL>
<DT><B>Range:</B>
<DD>Enter the range of image values and/or the specific 
    image values to which the selected color is to be applied.  Range values 
    should be separated by a dash (-) and individual image values should
    be seaprated by either a space or a comma (,).  The following conditions 
    cause an error message to be displayed:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The first character in the input specification is not numeric.
<LI>Any alphabetic characters appear in the specification.
<LI>Any punctuation marks other than a dash (-) or a comma (,) are used.
<LI>Two consecutive punctuation marks appear in the specification.
<LI>Both ends of a range are not specified (i.e. "10 - " or "- 100").
<LI>A value less than 0 or greater than 255 is specified.
</OL>
<P>

<DT><B>Definitions:</B>
<DD>This text field is an informational area informing the user of the color 
    assignments already made.  Assignments made from the color list are 
    displayed as a color name followed by the ranges and/or specific image 
    values the color was applied to.  Assignments made from the color sliders 
    are displayed as the red, green and blue color values followed by the 
    ranges and/or specific image values the color was applied to.
<P>

<DT><B>Color List:</B>
<DD>The color list is displayed only when the <B>color list</B> radio button 
    has been selected.  This is the list of standard X11 color names.  The 
    user must use the scrollbar at the right of the list to scroll through 
    the names of available colors.  To view a specific color, click the left
    mouse button on the color and it will be displayed in the box above the
    <B>apply</B> button.
<P>

<DT><B>Color Sliders:</B>
<DD>The color sliders are displayed only when the <B>color sliders</B>
    radio button has been selected.  These red, green, and blue sliders 
    are used to mix appropriate levels of red, green and blue to create 
    the desired color.  Slider values range from 0 (indicating no level 
    of the particular color should be used), to 255 (indicating the full 
    strength of the particular color should be used).  For example, 
    selecting a red value of 255 (full red), a green value of 255 
    (full green) and a blue value 0 (no blue) creates the color yellow.
    The resulting color will be displayed in the box above the <B>apply</B>
    button.
<P>

<DT><B>Color Box:</B>
<DD>The color box displayed above the <B>apply</B> button shows the user
    the currently selected color.
<P>

<DT><B>Apply:</B>
<DD>Apply the currently selected color to the range and/or individual image 
    values indicated by the <B>range</B> text field.  Validation of the range 
    specification is done at this time.  If an error is detected in the range 
    specification, the color is not applied.
<P>

<DT><B>Undo:</B>
<DD>Undo the last (and only the last) operation.  The last operation may 
    include the application of a color to the image, the restoration of the 
    initial mapping, or the application of a linear mapping.
<P>

<DT><B>Restore:</B>
<DD>Reload the mapping that was applied to the image when the pseudocolor 
    mapping function was initiated.
<P>

<DT><B>Linear:</B>
<DD>Load a linear or identity mapping.
<P>

<DT><B>Cancel:</B>
<DD>Close the pseudocolor mapping panel without saving the current pseudocolor 
    mapping.  The
    current mapping is not removed from the image, but other functions
    (such as <B>Cursor</B>) will have no knowledge of the mapping.
<P>

<DT><B>Dismiss:</B>
<DD>Close the pseudocolor mapping panel and save the current pseudocolor 
    mapping.  This does
    not save the mapping permanently.  It only indicates that other functions
    (such as <B>Cursor</B>) will now be aware of the mapping.
