<H2>7.1 Memory Layout</H2>

The layout function is used to change the number or size of memory
or image planes allocated, and/or to change the size of the 
displayed image area (viewport).

<DL>
<DT><B>Memory Plane Configuration:</B>
<DD>The memory plane configuration is defined by width, height
    and depth.  The size of the memory or image plane determines
    the maximum size of an image that can be loaded into memory.
    The depth of the memory plane determines how many bands of 
    an image and/or how many images can be loaded into memory at 
    one time.
<P>

<DT><B>Width:</B>
<DD>The memory plane width defines the number of samples that can be 
    loaded into memory.  Images larger than this size will be subsampled
    to fit within the defined width.  The default width is 1024.
<P>

<DT><B>Height:</B>
<DD>The memory plane height defines the number of lines that can be 
    loaded into memory.  Images larger than this size will be subsampled
    to fit within the defined height.  The default height is 1024.
<P>

<DT><B>Depth:</B>
<DD>The memory plane depth defines the number of image bands that can be 
loaded into memory at one time.  The default depth is three.
<P>

<DT><B>Viewport Configuration:</B>
<DD>The viewport configuration is defined by width and height.
    This size determines what portion of the loaded image is 
    visible.  If the loaded image is larger than the viewport
    size, scrollbars allow the user to view the remainder of
    the image.
<P>

<DT><B>Width:</B>
<DD>The viewport width defines the number of samples that are
    visible at one time.  The default width is 512.
<P>

<DT><B>Height:</B>
<DD>The viewport height defines the number of lines that are
    visible at one time.  The default height is 512.
<P>

<DT><B>Allocate:</B>
<DD>Allocate the amount of memory required based on the memory
    plane width, height and depth specified.  If a sufficient 
    amount of memory is available, the layout panel is closed.
    If a sufficient amount of memory is not available, an error
    message is displayed and the layout panel is left open so that
    the user may modify the layout parameters and try again.
</B>

<DT><B>Reset:</B>
<DD>Set both the memory plane configuration parameters and the viewport 
    configuration parameters back to their default values.
<P>

<DT><B>Cancel:</B>
<DD>Close the layout panel without modifying the current layout.
