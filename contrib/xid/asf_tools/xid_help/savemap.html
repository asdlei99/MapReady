<H2>5.3.5 Save Mapping</H2>

The save mapping function allows the user to save the currently
displayed mapping to a display and LUT file (DLTF).  The LUT
is saved in the DLTF associated with the first band of the
currently displayed image.  A separate LUT is stored for each
band of the displayed image and the band number associated with
the LUT is also saved.  If the DLTF exists, a new entry is
added.  If the DLTF does not exist, the save mapping function
will create it.  If the user does not have permission to write
to the file or is unable to create the file, a popup panel
with an error message is displayed and the user is required to
enter a DLTF name.
