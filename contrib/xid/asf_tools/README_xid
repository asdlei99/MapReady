INTRODUCTION:
 
    If you've gotten far enough to read this note, congratulations!
You've uncompressed and untarred the software correctly.  This note 
will tell you how to install the software you just untarred.
 
WHAT YOU'VE DOWNLOADED:
 
    This file is in a directory called asf_tools, which was
created when you untarred the software.  Also present in this
asf_tools directory are several sub-directories. Depending
on what you've downloaded, not all of these may be present.
Additionally, if you've downloaded other ASF STEP software
you may have other subdirectories. For xid these are the
files you should have:

INSTALLATION:

1. CHECK THAT YOU HAVE X-WINDOWS IN YOUR PATH:

Because XID uses X-Windows you need to have its software
subdirectory in your path environment variable.  To show your
current path variable use the command:

      echo $PATH

The path is usually set by a system start-up file and can be modified
by your start up file .profile or .cshrc.  

On most systems the X-Windows files are usually in /usr/lib/X11. 
If this is already in your path you can skip the rest of step 1.

If /usr/lib/X11 is not in your path you need to check this directory 
to see if it exists and if so you can add it to your path. Solaris systems 
in particular may not have this directory and solaris users need to 
follow the additional instructions if the X11 directory is not under 
/usr/lib.

If /usr/lib/X11 exists, adding it to your path depends on 
which shell you are running:

(ksh-- add these lines to your ~/.profile file)
        PATH=/usr/lib/X11:$PATH
        export PATH
 
(csh-- add this line to your ~/.cshrc file)
        setenv PATH /usr/lib/X11:$PATH

To re-run your start-up use the source command so that these will
take effect for your current session:
        source .cshrc

If X11 is not in /usr/lib/X11 you need to find out if it is on your 
system somewhere else.  On solaris systems it is usually under
/usr/openwin/lib/. XID expects it in /usr/lib/ so a link needs to be
set so that XID can find it. A system manager or someone with root
access will have to set up this link:

cd /usr/lib
ln -s /usr/openwin/lib/X11 X11

Once the link is set up you will still need to add /usr/lib/X11
to your path as shown above.
 
2. ADD THE XID BINARY TO YOUR PATH:
 
   Since when you untarred our software it installed the binaries
in the <your directory>/asf_tools/bin/<your system> directory, you
have to add this directory to your PATH environment variable.  
Exactly how you do this depends on where you installed the software 
and what UNIX shell (ksh or csh) you're using.  For example, if you're 
running Solaris and installed the software in your home directory
called '/user1/yourName', you need to:
 
(ksh-- add these lines to your ~/.profile file)
        PATH=/user1/yourName/asf_tools/bin/solaris:$PATH
        export PATH
 
(csh-- add this line to your ~/.cshrc file)
        setenv PATH /user1/yourName/asf_tools/bin/solaris:$PATH

Use the source command to re-run the start-up file so that these
take effect for your current session.
 
3. SET NEEDED ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
 
Two environment variables DATASYS and (WORCONFIG/LASTALBES) need to be
set.  Again how this is done depends on the shell (ksh or csh) you're
using.  If you installed the software in your home directory called
'/user1/yourName', you need to:

(ksh-- add these lines to your ~/.profile file)
        DATASYS=ieee-std
        export DATASYS
 
(csh-- add these lines to your ~/.cshrc file)
        setenv DATASYS ieee-std

For Solaris:
(ksh-- add these lines to your ~/.profile file)
        WORCONFIG=/user1/yourName/asf_tools/bin/solaris
        export WORCONFIG

(csh-- add these lines to your ~/.cshrc file)
        setenv WORCONFIG /user1/yourName/asf_tools/bin/solaris

Or for Irix:
(ksh-- add these lines to your ~/.profile file)
        DATASYS=ieee-std
        export DATASYS

(csh-- add these lines to your ~/.cshrc file)
        setenv DATASYS ieee-std
        setenv LASTABLES /user1/yourName/asf_tools/bin/solaris


4. ADD xid MAN PAGE:
 
  To access the xid man page, you need to add the asf_tools/man
directory to your MANPATH environment variable.  For example, if
you installed the ASF-STEP Tools in your home directory, the
MANPATH variable should have <your home directory>/asf_tools/man 
added to it. The exact way you do this depends on which UNIX shell 
(ksh or csh) you're using:
 
(ksh-- add these lines to your ~/.profile file)
        MANPATH=/user1/yourName/asf_tools/man:$MANPATH
        export MANPATH
 
(csh-- add this line to your ~/.cshrc file)
        setenv MANPATH /user1/yourName/asf_tools/man:$MANPATH

Use the source command again to make these take effect for your
current session.
 
Some systems may not have a MANPATH environment variable defined.
In this case you can set your own by replacing the $MANPATH above
with the rest of the man directories on your system as listed in
the man manual page. For example, an IRIX .cshrc file could contain:
       setenv MANPATH /user1/yourName/asf_tools/man:/usr/share/catman:
       /usr/share/man:/usr/catman:/usr/man

USAGE NOTES:

1. Filenames must be in lower case. The file load function uses the 
standard motif file selector to provide a list of *.img files in the 
current directory. This function only displays filenames that are in lower
case.  Any name typed into the selection box is converted to lower case.
A filename not in lower case may be rejected by file save functions.

2. The help function was implemented to use Mosaic to retrieve html
formatted help files.  This function is broken. While we are working on
a fix, we've provided the html files in the asf_tools/xid_help 
subdirectory. These can be viewed using your system's html browser
by opening the file using the complete filename e.g.

         /user1/yourName/asf_tools/xid_help/file.html

3. Colormap flashing problems. On some systems xid "shares" the colormap
used in other X applications resulting in color changes in other windows.
This also occurs in xid panels when selecting 256 colors in the preferences
option.

4. If you get an error "Error opening X color database" xid is not
finding the X window files. If you are on solaris check that you have an 
X11 link as described in Step 1 and that the file it points to contains 
rgb.txt.
